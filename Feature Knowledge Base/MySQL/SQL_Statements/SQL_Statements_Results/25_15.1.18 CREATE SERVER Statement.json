        "\n      This statement creates the definition of a server for use with the\n      FEDERATED storage engine. The CREATE\n      SERVER statement creates a new row in the\n      servers table in the mysql\n      database. This statement requires the\n      SUPER privilege.\n    ",
        "\n      The server_name\n      should be a unique reference to the server. Server definitions are\n      global within the scope of the server, it is not possible to\n      qualify the server definition to a specific database.\n      server_name has a\n      maximum length of 64 characters (names longer than 64 characters\n      are silently truncated), and is case-insensitive. You may specify\n      the name as a quoted string.\n    ",

        "\n      For each option you\n      must specify either a character literal or numeric literal.\n      Character literals are UTF-8, support a maximum length of 64\n      characters and default to a blank (empty) string. String literals\n      are silently truncated to 64 characters. Numeric literals must be\n      a number between 0 and 9999, default value is 0.\n",

The options\n      that you specify are used to populate the columns in the\n      mysql.servers table. The table columns are\n      Server_name, Host,\n      Db, Username,\n      Password, Port and\n      Socket.\n    ",
