        "\nLOOP implements a simple loop\n        construct, enabling repeated execution of the statement list,\n        which consists of one or more statements, each terminated by a\n        semicolon (;) statement delimiter. The\n        statements within the loop are repeated until the loop is\n        terminated. Usually, this is accomplished with a\n        LEAVE statement. Within a stored\n        function, RETURN can also be\n        used, which exits the function entirely.\n      ",
        "\n        Neglecting to include a loop-termination statement results in an\n        infinite loop.\n      ",
