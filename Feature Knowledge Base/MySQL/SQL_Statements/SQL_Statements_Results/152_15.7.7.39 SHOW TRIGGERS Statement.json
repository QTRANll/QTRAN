        "\nSHOW TRIGGERS lists the triggers\n        currently defined for tables in a database (the default database\n        unless a FROM clause is given). This\n        statement returns results only for databases and tables for\n        which you have the TRIGGER\n        privilege. The LIKE clause, if\n        present, indicates which table names (not trigger names) to\n        match and causes the statement to display triggers for those\n        tables. The WHERE clause can be given to\n        select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in\n        Section\u00a028.8, \u201cExtensions to SHOW Statements\u201d.\n      ",
