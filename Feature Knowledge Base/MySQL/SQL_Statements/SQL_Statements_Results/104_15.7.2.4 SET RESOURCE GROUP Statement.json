        "\ngroup_name identifies which resource\n        group to be assigned. Any thread_id\n        values indicate threads to assign to the group. Thread IDs can\n        be determined from the Performance Schema\n        threads table. If the resource\n        group or any named thread ID does not exist, an error occurs.\n      ",
