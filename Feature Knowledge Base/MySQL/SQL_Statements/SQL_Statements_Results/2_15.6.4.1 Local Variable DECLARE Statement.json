    "Description": [
        "\n        This statement declares local variables within stored programs.\n        To provide a default value for a variable, include a\n        DEFAULT clause. The value can be specified as\n        an expression; it need not be a constant. If the\n        DEFAULT clause is missing, the initial value\n        is NULL.\n      ",
        "\n        Local variables are treated like stored routine parameters with\n        respect to data type and overflow checking. See\n        Section\u00a015.1.17, \u201cCREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements\u201d.\n      ",
        "\n        Variable declarations must appear before cursor or handler\n        declarations.\n      ",
        "\n        Local variable names are not case-sensitive. Permissible\n        characters and quoting rules are the same as for other\n        identifiers, as described in Section\u00a011.2, \u201cSchema Object Names\u201d.\n      ",
        "\n        The scope of a local variable is the\n        BEGIN ...\n        END block within which it is declared. The variable\n        can be referred to in blocks nested within the declaring block,\n        except those blocks that declare a variable with the same name.\n      ",
        "\n        For examples of variable declarations, see\n        Section\u00a015.6.4.2, \u201cLocal Variable Scope and Resolution\u201d.\n"
