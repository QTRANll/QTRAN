        "\n\nImportant\n\n\n          The INFORMATION SCHEMA implementation of\n          SHOW PROCESSLIST is deprecated\n          and subject to removal in a future MySQL release. It is\n          recommended to use the Performance Schema implementation of\n          SHOW PROCESSLIST instead.\n\n",
        "\n        The MySQL process list indicates the operations currently being\n        performed by the set of threads executing within the server. The\n        SHOW PROCESSLIST statement is one\n        source of process information. For a comparison of this\n        statement with other sources, see\n        Sources of Process Information.\n",
        "\n\nNote\n\n\n          An alternative implementation for SHOW\n          PROCESSLIST is available based on the Performance\n          Schema processlist table, which,\n          unlike the default SHOW\n          PROCESSLIST implementation, does not require a mutex\n          and has better performance characteristics. For details, see\n          Section\u00a029.12.22.7, \u201cThe processlist Table\u201d.\n\n",
        "\n        If you have the PROCESS\n        privilege, you can see all threads, even those belonging to\n        other users. Otherwise (without the\n        PROCESS privilege), nonanonymous\n        users have access to information about their own threads but not\n        threads for other users, and anonymous users have no access to\n        thread information.\n      ",
        "\n        Without the FULL keyword,\n        SHOW PROCESSLIST displays only\n        the first 100 characters of each statement in the\n        Info field.\n      ",
        "\n        The SHOW PROCESSLIST statement is\n        very useful if you get the \u201ctoo many connections\u201d\n        error message and want to find out what is going on. MySQL\n        reserves one extra connection to be used by accounts that have\n        the CONNECTION_ADMIN privilege\n        (or the deprecated SUPER\n        privilege), to ensure that administrators should always be able\n        to connect and check the system (assuming that you are not\n        giving this privilege to all your users).\n      ",
        "\n        Threads can be killed with the\n        KILL statement. See\n        Section\u00a015.7.8.4, \u201cKILL Statement\u201d.\n      ",

        "\n\nId\n\n            The connection identifier. This is the same value displayed\n            in the ID column of the\n            INFORMATION_SCHEMA\nPROCESSLIST table, displayed in\n            the PROCESSLIST_ID column of the\n            Performance Schema threads\n            table, and returned by the\n            CONNECTION_ID() function\n            within the thread.\n          \nUser\n\n            The MySQL user who issued the statement. A value of\n            system user refers to a nonclient thread\n            spawned by the server to handle tasks internally, for\n            example, a delayed-row handler thread or an I/O (receiver)\n            or SQL (applier) thread used on replica hosts. For\n            system user, there is no host specified\n            in the Host column.\n            unauthenticated user refers to a thread\n            that has become associated with a client connection but for\n            which authentication of the client user has not yet\n            occurred. event_scheduler refers to the\n            thread that monitors scheduled events (see\n            Section\u00a027.4, \u201cUsing the Event Scheduler\u201d).\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n              A User value of system\n              user is distinct from the\n              SYSTEM_USER privilege. The\n              former designates internal threads. The latter\n              distinguishes the system user and regular user account\n              categories (see Section\u00a08.2.11, \u201cAccount Categories\u201d).\n\n\n\nHost\n\n            The host name of the client issuing the statement (except\n            for system user, for which there is no\n            host). The host name for TCP/IP connections is reported in\n            host_name:client_port\n            format to make it easier to determine which client is doing\n            what.\n          \ndb\n\n            The default database for the thread, or\n            NULL if none has been selected.\n          \nCommand\n\n            The type of command the thread is executing on behalf of the\n            client, or Sleep if the session is idle.\n            For descriptions of thread commands, see\n            Section\u00a010.14, \u201cExamining Server Thread (Process) Information\u201d. The value of this\n            column corresponds to the\n            COM_xxx\n            commands of the client/server protocol and\n            Com_xxx status\n            variables. See Section\u00a07.1.10, \u201cServer Status Variables\u201d.\n          \nTime\n\n            The time in seconds that the thread has been in its current\n            state. For a replica SQL thread, the value is the number of\n            seconds between the timestamp of the last replicated event\n            and the real time of the replica host. See\n            Section\u00a019.2.3, \u201cReplication Threads\u201d.\n          \nState\n\n            An action, event, or state that indicates what the thread is\n            doing. For descriptions of State values,\n            see Section\u00a010.14, \u201cExamining Server Thread (Process) Information\u201d.\n          \n            Most states correspond to very quick operations. If a thread\n            stays in a given state for many seconds, there might be a\n            problem that needs to be investigated.\n          \nInfo\n\n            The statement the thread is executing, or\n            NULL if it is executing no statement. The\n            statement might be the one sent to the server, or an\n            innermost statement if the statement executes other\n            statements. For example, if a CALL\n            statement executes a stored procedure that is executing a\n            SELECT statement, the\n            Info value shows the\n            SELECT statement.\n\n"
