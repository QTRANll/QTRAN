    "Description": [
        "\nDROP DATABASE drops all tables in\n      the database and deletes the database. Be\n      very careful with this statement! To use\n      DROP DATABASE, you need the\n      DROP privilege on the database.\n      DROP\n      SCHEMA is a synonym for DROP\n      DATABASE.\n",
        "\n\nImportant\n\n\n        When a database is dropped, privileges granted specifically for\n        the database are not automatically dropped.\n        They must be dropped manually. See Section\u00a015.7.1.6, \u201cGRANT Statement\u201d.\n\n",
        "\nIF EXISTS is used to prevent an error from\n      occurring if the database does not exist.\n    ",
        "\n      If the default database is dropped, the default database is unset\n      (the DATABASE() function returns\n      NULL).\n    ",
        "\n      If you use DROP DATABASE on a\n      symbolically linked database, both the link and the original\n      database are deleted.\n    ",
        "\nDROP DATABASE returns the number of\n      tables that were removed.\n    ",
        "\n      The DROP DATABASE statement removes\n      from the given database directory those files and directories that\n      MySQL itself may create during normal operation. This includes all\n      files with the extensions shown in the following list:\n",
        "\n\n.BAK\n\n.DAT\n\n.HSH\n\n.MRG\n\n.MYD\n\n.MYI\n\n.cfg\n\n.db\n\n.ibd\n\n.ndb\n\n",
        "\n      If other files or directories remain in the database directory\n      after MySQL removes those just listed, the database directory\n      cannot be removed. In this case, you must remove any remaining\n      files or directories manually and issue the\n      DROP DATABASE statement again.\n    ",
        "\n      Dropping a database does not remove any\n      TEMPORARY tables that were created in that\n      database. TEMPORARY tables are automatically\n      removed when the session that created them ends. See\n      Section\u00a015.1.20.2, \u201cCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Statement\u201d.\n    ",
        "\n      You can also drop databases with mysqladmin.\n      See Section\u00a06.5.2, \u201cmysqladmin \u2014 A MySQL Server Administration Program\u201d.\n"
