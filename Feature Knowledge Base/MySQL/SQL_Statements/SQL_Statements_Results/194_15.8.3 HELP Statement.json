        "\n      The HELP statement returns online\n      information from the MySQL Reference Manual. Its proper operation\n      requires that the help tables in the mysql\n      database be initialized with help topic information (see\n      Section\u00a07.1.17, \u201cServer-Side Help Support\u201d).\n    ",
        "\n      The HELP statement searches the\n      help tables for the given search string and displays the result of\n      the search. The search string is not case-sensitive.\n    ",
        "\n      The search string can contain the wildcard characters\n      % and _. These have the same\n      meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed with the\n      LIKE operator. For example,\n      HELP 'rep%' returns a list of topics that begin\n      with rep.\n    ",
        "\n      The HELP statement does not require a\n      terminator such as ; or \\G.\n    ",
        "\n      The HELP statement understands several types of\n      search strings:\n",
        "\n\n          At the most general level, use contents to\n          retrieve a list of the top-level help categories:\n        Press CTRL+C to copy HELP 'contents'\n          For a list of topics in a given help category, such as\n          Data Types, use the category name:\n        Press CTRL+C to copy HELP 'data types'\n          For help on a specific help topic, such as the\n          ASCII() function or the\n          CREATE TABLE statement, use the\n          associated keyword or keywords:\n        Press CTRL+C to copy HELP 'ascii'\nHELP 'create table'\n",
        "\n      In other words, the search string matches a category, many topics,\n      or a single topic. The following descriptions indicate the forms\n      that the result set can take.\n",

The result includes the following items:\n\n\n\nname: The topic name.\n            \ndescription: Descriptive help text for\n              the topic.\n            \nexample: One or more usage examples.\n              (May be empty.)\n\n\n\n          Example: HELP 'log'\n\n          Yields:\n        Press CTRL+C to copy Name: 'LOG'\nDescription:\nSyntax:\nLOG(X), LOG(B,X)\n\nIf called with one parameter, this function returns the natural\nlogarithm of X.
