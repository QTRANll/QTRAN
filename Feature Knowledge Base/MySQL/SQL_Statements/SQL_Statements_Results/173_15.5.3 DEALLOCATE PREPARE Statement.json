        "\n      To deallocate a prepared statement produced with\n      PREPARE, use a\n      DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement that\n      refers to the prepared statement name. Attempting to execute a\n      prepared statement after deallocating it results in an error. If\n      too many prepared statements are created and not deallocated by\n      either the DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement or the\n      end of the session, you might encounter the upper limit enforced\n      by the max_prepared_stmt_count\n      system variable.\n    ",
