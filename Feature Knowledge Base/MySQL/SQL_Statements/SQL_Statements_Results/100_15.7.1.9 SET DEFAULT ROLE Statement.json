However,\n        ALTER USER can set the default\n        for only a single user, whereas SET DEFAULT\n        ROLE can set the default for multiple users. On the\n        other hand, you can specify CURRENT_USER as\n        the user name for the ALTER USER\n        statement, whereas you cannot for SET\n        DEFAULT ROLE.\n      ",
