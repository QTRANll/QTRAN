    "Description": [
        "\n        The RENAME USER statement renames\n        existing MySQL accounts. An error occurs for old accounts that\n        do not exist or new accounts that already exist.\n      ",
        "\n        To use RENAME USER, you must have\n        the global CREATE USER privilege,\n        or the UPDATE privilege for the\n        mysql system schema. When the\n        read_only system variable is\n        enabled, RENAME USER additionally\n        requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN\n        privilege (or the deprecated\n        SUPER privilege).\n      ",
        "\nRENAME USER fails with an error\n        if any account to be renamed is named as the\n        DEFINER attribute for any stored object.\n        (That is, the statement fails if renaming an account would cause\n        a stored object to become orphaned.) To perform the operation\n        anyway, you must have the\n        SET_ANY_DEFINER or\n        ALLOW_NONEXISTENT_DEFINER\n        privilege; in this case, the statement succeeds with a warning\n        rather than failing with an error. For additional information,\n        including how to identify which objects name a given account as\n        the DEFINER attribute, see\n        Orphan Stored Objects.\n      ",
        "\n        Each account name uses the format described in\n        Section\u00a08.2.4, \u201cSpecifying Account Names\u201d. For example:\n      ",

        "\nRENAME USER causes the privileges\n        held by the old user to be those held by the new user. However,\n        RENAME USER does not\n        automatically drop or invalidate databases or objects within\n        them that the old user created. This includes stored programs or\n        views for which the DEFINER attribute names\n        the old user. Attempts to access such objects may produce an\n        error if they execute in definer security context.
