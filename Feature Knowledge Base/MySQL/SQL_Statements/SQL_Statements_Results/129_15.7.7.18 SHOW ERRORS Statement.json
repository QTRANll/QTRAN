        "\nSHOW ERRORS is a diagnostic\n        statement that is similar to SHOW\n        WARNINGS, except that it displays information only for\n        errors, rather than for errors, warnings, and notes.\n      ",
        "\n        The LIMIT clause has the same syntax as for\n        the SELECT statement. See\n        Section\u00a015.2.13, \u201cSELECT Statement\u201d.\n      ",
        "\n        The SHOW COUNT(*)\n        ERRORS statement displays the number of errors. You\n        can also retrieve this number from the\n        error_count variable:\n      ",

In particular,\n        SHOW ERRORS cannot display\n        information for more than\n        max_error_count messages, and\n        error_count can exceed the\n        value of max_error_count if the\n        number of errors exceeds\n        max_error_count.\n      ",
