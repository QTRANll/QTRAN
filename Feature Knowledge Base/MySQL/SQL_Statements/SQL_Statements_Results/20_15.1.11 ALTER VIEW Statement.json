This statement\n      requires the CREATE VIEW and\n      DROP privileges for the view, and\n      some privilege for each column referred to in the\n      SELECT statement.\n      ALTER VIEW is permitted only to the\n      definer or users with the\n      SET_ANY_DEFINER or\n      ALLOW_NONEXISTENT_DEFINER\n      privilege.\n"
