        "\n      The PREPARE statement prepares a\n      SQL statement and assigns it a name,\n      stmt_name, by which to refer to the\n      statement later. The prepared statement is executed with\n      EXECUTE and released with\n      DEALLOCATE PREPARE. For examples,\n      see Section\u00a015.5, \u201cPrepared Statements\u201d.\n    ",
        "\n      Statement names are not case-sensitive.\n      preparable_stmt is either a string\n      literal or a user variable that contains the text of the SQL\n      statement. The text must represent a single statement, not\n      multiple statements. Within the statement, ?\n      characters can be used as parameter markers to indicate where data\n      values are to be bound to the query later when you execute it. The\n      ? characters should not be enclosed within\n      quotation marks, even if you intend to bind them to string values.\n      Parameter markers can be used only where data values should\n      appear, not for SQL keywords, identifiers, and so forth.\n    ",
        "\n      If a prepared statement with the given name already exists, it is\n      deallocated implicitly before the new statement is prepared. This\n      means that if the new statement contains an error and cannot be\n      prepared, an error is returned and no statement with the given\n      name exists.\n    ",
        "\n      The scope of a prepared statement is the session within which it\n      is created, which as several implications:\n",
        "\n\n          A prepared statement created in one session is not available\n          to other sessions.\n        \n          When a session ends, whether normally or abnormally, its\n          prepared statements no longer exist. If auto-reconnect is\n          enabled, the client is not notified that the connection was\n          lost. For this reason, clients may wish to disable\n          auto-reconnect. See Automatic Reconnection Control.\n        \n          A prepared statement created within a stored program continues\n          to exist after the program finishes executing and can be\n          executed outside the program later.\n        \n          A statement prepared in stored program context cannot refer to\n          stored procedure or function parameters or local variables\n          because they go out of scope when the program ends and would\n          be unavailable were the statement to be executed later outside\n          the program. As a workaround, refer instead to user-defined\n          variables, which also have session scope; see\n          Section\u00a011.4, \u201cUser-Defined Variables\u201d.\n\n",
        "\n      The type of a parameter used in a prepared statement is determined\n      when the statement is first prepared; it retains this type\n      whenever EXECUTE is invoked for\n      this prepared statement (unless the statement is reprepared, as\n      explained later in this section). Rules for determining a\n      parameter's type are listed here:\n",
        "\n\n          A parameter which is an operand of a binary arithmetic\n          operator has the same data type as the other operand.\n        \n          If both operands of a binary arithmetic operator are\n          parameters, the type of the parameters is decided by the\n          context of the operator.\n        \n          If a parameter is the operand of a unary arithmetic operator,\n          the parameter's type is decided by the context of the\n          operator.\n        \n          If an arithmetic operator has no type-determining context, the\n          derived type for any parameters involved is\n          DOUBLE PRECISION.

For these reasons, it is advisable to use\n      the same data type for a given parameter when re-executing a\n      prepared statement.\n"
