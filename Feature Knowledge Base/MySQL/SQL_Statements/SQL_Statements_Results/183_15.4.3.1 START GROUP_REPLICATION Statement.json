        "\n        Starts group replication. This statement requires the\n        GROUP_REPLICATION_ADMIN privilege\n        (or the deprecated SUPER\n        privilege). If\n        super_read_only=ON is set and\n        the member should join as a primary,\n        super_read_only is set to\n        OFF once Group Replication successfully\n        starts.\n      ",

        "\n        You can specify user credentials for distributed recovery in the\n        START GROUP_REPLICATION statement using the\n        USER, PASSWORD, and\n        DEFAULT_AUTH options, as follows:\n",
        "\n\nUSER: The replication user for\n            distributed recovery. For instructions to set up this\n            account, see\n            Section\u00a020.2.1.3, \u201cUser Credentials For Distributed Recovery\u201d. You\n            cannot specify an empty or null string, or omit the\n            USER option if\n            PASSWORD is specified.\n          \nPASSWORD: The password for the\n            replication user account. The password cannot be encrypted,\n            but it is masked in the query log.\n          \nDEFAULT_AUTH: The name of the\n            authentication plugin used for the replication user account.\n            If you do not specify this option, MySQL native\n            authentication (the mysql_native_password\n            plugin) is assumed. This option acts as a hint to the\n            server, and the donor for distributed recovery overrides it\n            if a different plugin is associated with the user account on\n            that server. The authentication plugin used by default when\n            you create user accounts in MySQL 8 is the caching SHA-2\n            authentication plugin\n            (caching_sha2_password). See\n            Section\u00a08.2.17, \u201cPluggable Authentication\u201d for more\n            information on authentication plugins.\n\n",

You\n        must issue a START GROUP_REPLICATION\n        statement to provide the credentials again. This method is\n        therefore not compatible with starting Group Replication\n        automatically on server start, as specified by the\n        group_replication_start_on_boot\n        system variable.\n      ",

To gain the\n        security benefits of specifying user credentials on\n        START GROUP_REPLICATION, ensure that\n        group_replication_start_on_boot\n        is set to OFF (the default is\n        ON), and clear any user credentials\n        previously set for the\n        group_replication_recovery channel, following\n        the instructions in\n        Section\u00a020.6.3, \u201cSecuring Distributed Recovery Connections\u201d.\n      ",
