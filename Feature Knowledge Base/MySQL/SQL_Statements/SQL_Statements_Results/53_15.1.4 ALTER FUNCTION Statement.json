        "\n      This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a\n      stored function. More than one change may be specified in an\n      ALTER FUNCTION statement. However,\n      you cannot change the parameters or body of a stored function\n      using this statement; to make such changes, you must drop and\n      re-create the function using DROP\n      FUNCTION and CREATE\n      FUNCTION.\n    ",
        "\n      You must have the ALTER ROUTINE\n      privilege for the function. (That privilege is granted\n      automatically to the function creator.) If binary logging is\n      enabled, the ALTER FUNCTION\n      statement might also require the\n      SUPER privilege, as described in\n      Section\u00a027.7, \u201cStored Program Binary Logging\u201d.\n"
