        "\nRESET PERSIST removes persisted\n        global system variable settings from the\n        mysqld-auto.cnf option file in the data\n        directory. Removing a persisted system variable causes the\n        variable no longer to be initialized from\n        mysqld-auto.cnf at server startup. For more\n        information about persisting system variables and the\n        mysqld-auto.cnf file, see\n        Section\u00a07.1.9.3, \u201cPersisted System Variables\u201d.\n      ",
