    "Description": [
        "\n        This statement declares a cursor and associates it with a\n        SELECT statement that retrieves\n        the rows to be traversed by the cursor. To fetch the rows later,\n        use a FETCH statement. The number\n        of columns retrieved by the\n        SELECT statement must match the\n        number of output variables specified in the\n        FETCH statement.\n      ",
        "\n        The SELECT statement cannot have\n        an INTO clause.\n      ",
        "\n        Cursor declarations must appear before handler declarations and\n        after variable and condition declarations.\n      ",
        "\n        A stored program may contain multiple cursor declarations, but\n        each cursor declared in a given block must have a unique name.\n        For an example, see Section\u00a015.6.6, \u201cCursors\u201d.\n      ",
        "\n        For information available through\n        SHOW statements, it is possible\n        in many cases to obtain equivalent information by using a cursor\n        with an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table.\n"
