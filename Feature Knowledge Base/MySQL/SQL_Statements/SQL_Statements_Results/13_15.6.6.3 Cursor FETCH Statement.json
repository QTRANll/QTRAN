        "\n        This statement fetches the next row for the\n        SELECT statement associated with\n        the specified cursor (which must be open), and advances the\n        cursor pointer. If a row exists, the fetched columns are stored\n        in the named variables. The number of columns retrieved by the\n        SELECT statement must match the\n        number of output variables specified in the\n        FETCH statement.\n      ",
        "\n        If no more rows are available, a No Data condition occurs with\n        SQLSTATE value '02000'. To detect this\n        condition, you can set up a handler for it (or for a\n        NOT FOUND condition). For an example, see\n        Section\u00a015.6.6, \u201cCursors\u201d.\n      ",
        "\n        Be aware that another operation, such as a\n        SELECT or another FETCH,\n        may also cause the handler to execute by raising the same\n        condition. If it is necessary to distinguish which operation\n        raised the condition, place the operation within its own\n        BEGIN ...\n        END block so that it can be associated with its own\n        handler.\n"
