    "Description": [
        "\nBINLOG is an internal-use\n        statement. It is generated by the mysqlbinlog\n        program as the printable representation of certain events in\n        binary log files. (See Section\u00a06.6.9, \u201cmysqlbinlog \u2014 Utility for Processing Binary Log Files\u201d.) The\n        'str' value is a\n        base 64-encoded string the that server decodes to determine the\n        data change indicated by the corresponding event.\n      ",
        "\n        To execute BINLOG statements when\n        applying mysqlbinlog output, a user account\n        requires the BINLOG_ADMIN\n        privilege (or the deprecated\n        SUPER privilege), or the\n        REPLICATION_APPLIER privilege\n        plus the appropriate privileges to execute each log event.\n      ",
        "\n        This statement can execute only format description events and\n        row events.\n"
