        "\nALTER RESOURCE GROUP is used for\n        resource group management (see\n        Section\u00a07.1.16, \u201cResource Groups\u201d). This statement alters\n        modifiable attributes of an existing resource group. It requires\n        the RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN\n        privilege.\n      ",

        "\n        The attributes for CPU affinity, priority, and whether the group\n        is enabled can be modified with ALTER\n        RESOURCE GROUP. These attributes are specified the\n        same way as described for CREATE RESOURCE\n        GROUP (see Section\u00a015.7.2.2, \u201cCREATE RESOURCE GROUP Statement\u201d).\n        Only the attributes specified are altered. Unspecified\n        attributes retain their current values.\n      ",
        "\n        The FORCE modifier is used with\n        DISABLE. It determines statement behavior if\n        the resource group has any threads assigned to it:\n",
