        "\nSHOW has many forms that provide\n      information about databases, tables, columns, or status\n      information about the server. This section describes those\n      following:\n    ",
        "\n      If the syntax for a given SHOW\n      statement includes a LIKE\n      'pattern' part,\n      'pattern' is a\n      string that can contain the SQL % and\n      _ wildcard characters. The pattern is useful\n      for restricting statement output to matching values.\n    ",
        "\n      Several SHOW statements also accept\n      a WHERE clause that provides more flexibility\n      in specifying which rows to display. See\n      Section\u00a028.8, \u201cExtensions to SHOW Statements\u201d.\n    ",
        "\n      In SHOW statement results, user\n      names and host names are quoted using backticks (`).\n    ",
        "\n      Many MySQL APIs (such as PHP) enable you to treat the result\n      returned from a SHOW statement as\n      you would a result set from a\n      SELECT; see\n      Chapter\u00a031, Connectors and APIs, or your API documentation for\n      more information. In addition, you can work in SQL with results\n      from queries on tables in the\n      INFORMATION_SCHEMA database, which you cannot\n      easily do with results from SHOW\n      statements. See Chapter\u00a028, INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables.\n"
