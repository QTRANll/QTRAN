        "\nDROP VIEW removes one or more\n      views. You must have the DROP\n      privilege for each view.\n    ",
        "\n      If any views named in the argument list do not exist, the\n      statement fails with an error indicating by name which nonexisting\n      views it was unable to drop, and no changes are made.\n",
        "\n\nNote\n\n\n        In MySQL 8.3 and earlier,\n        DROP VIEW returns an error if any\n        views named in the argument list do not exist, but also drops\n        all views in the list that do exist. Due to the change in\n        behavior in MySQL 8.4, a partially completed\n        DROP VIEW operation on a MySQL\n        8.3 replication source server fails when\n        replicated on a MySQL 8.4 replica. To avoid this\n        failure scenario, use IF EXISTS syntax in\n        DROP VIEW statements to prevent\n        an error from occurring for views that do not exist. For more\n        information, see Section\u00a015.1.1, \u201cAtomic Data Definition Statement Support\u201d.\n\n",
        "\n      The IF EXISTS clause prevents an error from\n      occurring for views that don't exist. When this clause is given, a\n      NOTE is generated for each nonexistent view.\n      See Section\u00a015.7.7.41, \u201cSHOW WARNINGS Statement\u201d.\n    ",
        "\nRESTRICT and CASCADE, if\n      given, are parsed and ignored.\n"
