    "Description": [
        "\nDROP INDEX drops the index named\n      index_name from the table\n      tbl_name. This statement is mapped to\n      an ALTER TABLE statement to drop\n      the index. See Section\u00a015.1.9, \u201cALTER TABLE Statement\u201d.\n    ",
        "\n      To drop a primary key, the index name is always\n      PRIMARY, which must be specified as a quoted\n      identifier because PRIMARY is a reserved word:\n    ",

        "\n      Indexes on variable-width columns of\n      NDB tables are dropped online; that\n      is, without any table copying. The table is not locked against\n      access from other NDB Cluster API nodes, although it is locked\n      against other operations on the same API node\n      for the duration of the operation. This is done automatically by\n      the server whenever it determines that it is possible to do so;\n      you do not have to use any special SQL syntax or server options to\n      cause it to happen.\n    ",
        "\nALGORITHM and LOCK clauses\n      may be given to influence the table copying method and level of\n      concurrency for reading and writing the table while its indexes\n      are being modified. They have the same meaning as for the\n      ALTER TABLE statement. For more\n      information, see Section\u00a015.1.9, \u201cALTER TABLE Statement\u201d\n",
