        "\n        A loadable function is a way to extend MySQL with a new function\n        that works like a native (built-in) MySQL function such as\n        ABS() or\n        CONCAT(). See\n        Adding a Loadable Function.\n      ",
        "\nfunction_name is the name that should\n        be used in SQL statements to invoke the function. The\n        RETURNS clause indicates the type of the\n        function's return value. DECIMAL is a legal\n        value after RETURNS, but currently\n        DECIMAL functions return string values and\n        should be written like STRING functions.\n      ",
        "\nIF NOT EXISTS prevents an error from\n        occurring if there already exists a loadable function with the\n        same name. It does not prevent an error\n        from occurring if there already exists a built-in function\n        having the same name. IF NOT EXISTS is also\n        supported for CREATE FUNCTION statements. See\n        Function Name Resolution.\n      ",
        "\n        The AGGREGATE keyword, if given, signifies\n        that the function is an aggregate (group) function. An aggregate\n        function works exactly like a native MySQL aggregate function\n        such as SUM() or\n        COUNT().\n      ",

Unlike the mysql.func\n          table, the user_defined_functions\n          table also lists loadable functions installed automatically by\n          server components or plugins. This difference makes\n          user_defined_functions preferable\n          to mysql.func for checking which loadable\n          functions are installed.\n\n",
