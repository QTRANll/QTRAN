    "Description": [
        "\nDO executes the expressions but\n      does not return any results. In most respects,\n      DO is shorthand for SELECT\n      expr, ..., but has the\n      advantage that it is slightly faster when you do not care about\n      the result.\n    ",
        "\nDO is useful primarily with\n      functions that have side effects, such as\n      RELEASE_LOCK().\n    ",
        "\n      Example: This SELECT statement\n      pauses, but also produces a result set:\n    ",
        "Press CTRL+C to copy mysql> SELECT SLEEP(5);\n+----------+\n| SLEEP(5) |\n+----------+\n|        0 |\n+----------+\n1 row in set (5.02 sec)",
        "\nDO, on the other hand, pauses\n      without producing a result set.:\n    ",
        "Press CTRL+C to copy mysql> DO SLEEP(5);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (4.99 sec)",
        "\n      This could be useful, for example in a stored function or trigger,\n      which prohibit statements that produce result sets.\n    ",
        "\nDO only executes expressions. It\n      cannot be used in all cases where SELECT can be\n      used. For example, DO id FROM t1 is invalid\n      because it references a table.\n"
