        "\n        This statement is a MySQL extension. It returns characteristics\n        of a stored procedure, such as the database, name, type,\n        creator, creation and modification dates, and character set\n        information. A similar statement, SHOW\n        FUNCTION STATUS, displays information about stored\n        functions (see Section\u00a015.7.7.21, \u201cSHOW FUNCTION STATUS Statement\u201d).\n      ",
