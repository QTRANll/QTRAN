    "Description": [
        "\n        This statement deactivates and uninstalls one or more\n        components. A component provides services that are available to\n        the server and other components; see\n        Section\u00a07.5, \u201cMySQL Components\u201d. UNINSTALL\n        COMPONENT is the complement of\n        INSTALL COMPONENT. It requires\n        the DELETE privilege for the\n        mysql.component system table because it\n        removes the row from that table that registers the component.\n        UNINSTALL COMPONENT does not undo\n        persisted variables, including the variables persisted using\n        INSTALL COMPONENT ... SET PERSIST.\n      ",
        "\n        Example:\n      ",
        "Press CTRL+C to copy UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component1', 'file://component2';",
        "\n        For information about component naming, see\n        Section\u00a015.7.4.3, \u201cINSTALL COMPONENT Statement\u201d.\n      ",
        "\n        If any error occurs, the statement fails and has no effect. For\n        example, this happens if a component name is erroneous, a named\n        component is not installed, or cannot be uninstalled because\n        other installed components depend on it.\n      ",
        "\n        A loader service handles component unloading, which includes\n        removing uninstalled components from the\n        mysql.component system table that serves as a\n        registry. As a result, unloaded components are not loaded during\n        the startup sequence for subsequent server restarts.\n",
        "\n\nNote\n\n\n          This statement has no effect for keyring components, which are\n          loaded using a manifest file and cannot be uninstalled. See\n          Section\u00a08.4.4.2, \u201cKeyring Component Installation\u201d.\n\n"
