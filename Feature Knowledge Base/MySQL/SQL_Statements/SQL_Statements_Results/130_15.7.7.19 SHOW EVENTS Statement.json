The default value is\n            SYSTEM.\n          \nType\n\n            The event repetition type, either ONE\n            TIME (transient) or RECURRING\n            (repeating).\n          \nExecute At\n\n            For a one-time event, this is the\n            DATETIME value specified in\n            the AT clause of the\n            CREATE EVENT statement used\n            to create the event, or of the last\n            ALTER EVENT statement that\n            modified the event. The value shown in this column reflects\n            the addition or subtraction of any\n            INTERVAL value included in the event's\n            AT clause. For example, if an event is\n            created using ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP +\n            '1:6' DAY_HOUR, and the event was created at\n            2018-02-09 14:05:30, the value shown in this column would be\n            '2018-02-10 20:05:30'. If the event's\n            timing is determined by an EVERY clause\n            instead of an AT clause (that is, if the\n            event is recurring), the value of this column is\n            NULL.\n          \nInterval Value\n\n            For a recurring event, the number of intervals to wait\n            between event executions. For a transient event, the value\n            of this column is always NULL.\n          \nInterval Field\n\n            The time units used for the interval which a recurring event\n            waits before repeating. For a transient event, the value of\n            this column is always NULL.\n          \nStarts\n\n            The start date and time for a recurring event. This is\n            displayed as a DATETIME\n            value, and is NULL if no start date and\n            time are defined for the event. For a transient event, this\n            column is always NULL. For a recurring\n            event whose definition includes a STARTS\n            clause, this column contains the corresponding\n            DATETIME value. As with the\n            Execute At column, this value resolves\n            any expressions used. If there is no\n            STARTS clause affecting the timing of the\n            event, this column is NULL\n\nEnds\n\n            For a recurring event whose definition includes a\n            ENDS clause, this column contains the\n            corresponding DATETIME value.\n            As with the Execute At column, this value\n            resolves any expressions used. If there is no\n            ENDS clause affecting the timing of the\n            event, this column is NULL.\n          \nStatus\n\n            The event status. One of ENABLED,\n            DISABLED, or\n            REPLICA_SIDE_DISABLED.\n            REPLICA_SIDE_DISABLED indicates that the\n            creation of the event occurred on another MySQL server\n            acting as a replication source and replicated to the current\n            MySQL server which is acting as a replica, but the event is\n            not presently being executed on the replica. For more\n            information, see\n            Section\u00a019.5.1.16, \u201cReplication of Invoked Features\u201d. information.\n          \nREPLICA_SIDE_DISABLED replaces\n            SLAVESIDE_DISABLED, which is now\n            deprecated and subject to removal in a future version of\n            MySQL.\n          \nOriginator\n\n            The server ID of the MySQL server on which the event was\n            created; used in replication. This value may be updated by\n            ALTER EVENT to the server ID\n            of the server on which that statement occurs, if executed on\n            a source server. The default value is 0.\n          \ncharacter_set_client\n\n            The session value of the\n            character_set_client system\n            variable when the event was created.\n          \ncollation_connection\n\n            The session value of the\n            collation_connection system\n            variable when the event was created.\n          \nDatabase Collation\n\n            The collation of the database with which the event is\n            associated.\n\n",
