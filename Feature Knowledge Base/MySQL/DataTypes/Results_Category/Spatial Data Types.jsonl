The other single-value types (POINT,\n        LINESTRING, and POLYGON)\n        restrict their values to a particular geometry type.\n      \n        The other spatial data types hold collections of values:\n\n\n\nMULTIPOINT\n\nMULTILINESTRING\n\nMULTIPOLYGON\n\nGEOMETRYCOLLECTION\n\n\n\nGEOMETRYCOLLECTION can store a collection of\n        objects of any type. The other collection types\n        (MULTIPOINT,\n        MULTILINESTRING, and\n        MULTIPOLYGON) restrict collection members to\n        those having a particular geometry type.\n      \n        Example: To create a table named geom that\n        has a column named g that can store values of\n        any geometry type, use this statement:\n      Press CTRL+C to copy CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY);\n        Columns with a spatial data type can have an\n        SRID attribute, to explicitly indicate the\n        spatial reference system (SRS) for values stored in the column.\n        For example:\n      Press CTRL+C to copy CREATE TABLE geom (\n    p POINT SRID 0,\n    g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326\n);\nSPATIAL indexes can be created on spatial\n        columns if they are NOT NULL and have a\n        specific SRID, so if you plan to index the column, declare it\n        with the NOT NULL and SRID\n        attributes:\n      Press CTRL+C to copy CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326);\nInnoDB tables permit SRID\n        values for Cartesian and geographic SRSs.\n        MyISAM tables permit SRID\n        values for Cartesian SRSs.\n      \n        The SRID attribute makes a spatial column\n        SRID-restricted, which has these implications:\n\n\n\n            The column can contain only values with the given SRID.\n            Attempts to insert values with a different SRID produce an\n            error.\n          \n            The optimizer can use SPATIAL indexes on\n            the column. See\n            Section\u00a010.3.3, \u201cSPATIAL Index Optimization\u201d.\n\n\n\n        Spatial columns with no SRID attribute are\n        not SRID-restricted and accept values with any SRID. However,\n        the optimizer cannot use SPATIAL indexes on\n        them until the column definition is modified to include an\n        SRID attribute, which may require that the\n        column contents first be modified so that all values have the\n        same SRID.\n      \n        For other examples showing how to use spatial data types in\n        MySQL, see Section\u00a013.4.6, \u201cCreating Spatial Columns\u201d.
