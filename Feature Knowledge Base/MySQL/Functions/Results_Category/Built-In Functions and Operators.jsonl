Both HKDF and PBKDF2 can use salts, and their\n                use is recommended to help prevent attacks based on\n                dictionaries of common passwords or rainbow tables.\n              \n                A salt consists of random data, which for security must\n                be different for each encryption operation.

A higher count gives greater resistance\n                to brute-force attacks because it has a greater\n                computational cost for the attacker, but the same is\n                necessarily true for the key derivation process.

To specify a separator explicitly,\n            use SEPARATOR followed by the string\n            literal value that should be inserted between group values.\n            To eliminate the separator altogether, specify\n            SEPARATOR ''.\n          ", "\n            The result is truncated to the maximum length that is given\n            by the group_concat_max_len\n            system variable, which has a default value of 1024. The\n            value can be set higher, although the effective maximum\n            length of the return value is constrained by the value of\n            max_allowed_packet. The\n            syntax to change the value of\n            group_concat_max_len at\n            runtime is as follows, where val\n            is an unsigned integer:\n          ", "Press CTRL+C to copy SET [GLOBAL | SESSION] group_concat_max_len = val;", "\n            The return value is a nonbinary or binary string, depending\n            on whether the arguments are nonbinary or binary strings.\n            The result type is TEXT or\n            BLOB unless\n            group_concat_max_len is\n            less than or equal to 512, in which case the result type is\n            VARCHAR or\n            VARBINARY.\n          ", "\n            If GROUP_CONCAT() is invoked\n            from within the mysql client, binary\n            string results display using hexadecimal notation, depending\n            on the value of the\n            --binary-as-hex.
