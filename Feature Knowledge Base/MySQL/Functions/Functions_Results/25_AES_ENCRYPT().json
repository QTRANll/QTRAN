By default these functions implement AES with a\n          128-bit key length. Key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be\n          used, as described later. The key length is a trade off\n          between performance and security.\n        ",

(To obtain\n          the string as plaintext, cast the result to\n          CHAR. Alternatively, start the\n          mysql client with\n          --skip-binary-as-hex\n          to cause all binary values to be displayed as text.) If either\n          function argument is NULL, the function\n          returns NULL. If\n          AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid\n          data or incorrect padding, it returns NULL.\n          However, it is possible for\n          AES_DECRYPT() to return a\n          non-NULL value (possibly garbage) if the\n          input data or the key is invalid.\n        ",
        "\n          These functions support the use of a key derivation function\n          (KDF) to create a cryptographically strong secret key from the\n          information passed in key_str. The\n          derived key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data, and it\n          remains in the MySQL Server instance and is not accessible to\n          users. Using a KDF is highly recommended, as it provides\n          better security than specifying your own premade key or\n          deriving it by a simpler method as you use the function. The\n          functions support HKDF (available from OpenSSL 1.1.0), for\n          which you can specify an optional salt and context-specific\n          information to include in the keying material, and PBKDF2\n          (available from OpenSSL 1.0.2), for which you can specify an\n          optional salt and set the number of iterations used to produce\n          the key.\n        ",

For the same instance of\n                data, use the same value of\n                key_str for encryption with\n                AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n              \n                If you are using a KDF,\n                key_str can be any arbitrary\n                information such as a password or passphrase. In the\n                further arguments for the function, you specify the KDF\n                name, then add further options to increase the security\n                as appropriate for the KDF.\n              \n                When you use a KDF, the function creates a\n                cryptographically strong secret key from the information\n                passed in key_str and any\n                salt or additional information that you provide in the\n                other arguments. The derived key is used to encrypt and\n                decrypt the data, and it remains in the MySQL Server\n                instance and is not accessible to users. Using a KDF is\n                highly recommended, as it provides better security than\n                specifying your own premade key or deriving it by a\n                simpler method as you use the function.\n              \n                If you are not using a KDF, for a key length of 128\n                bits, the most secure way to pass a key to the\n                key_str argument is to create\n                a truly random 128-bit value and pass it as a binary\n                value. For example:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy INSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text',UNHEX('F3229A0B371ED2D9441B830D21A390C3')));\n                A passphrase can be used to generate an AES key by\n                hashing the passphrase. For example:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy INSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text', UNHEX(SHA2('My secret passphrase',512))));\n                If you exceed the maximum key length of 128 bits, a\n                warning is returned. If you are not using a KDF, do not\n                pass a password or passphrase directly to\n                key_str, hash it first.\n                Previous versions of this documentation suggested the\n                former approach, but it is no longer recommended as the\n                examples shown here are more secure.\n              \ninit_vector\n\n                An initialization vector, for block encryption modes\n                that require it. The\n                block_encryption_mode\n                system variable controls the mode. For the same instance\n                of data, use the same value of\n                init_vector for encryption\n                with AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n                  If you are using a KDF, you must specify an\n                  initialization vector or a null string for this\n                  argument, in order to access the later arguments to\n                  define the KDF.\n\n\n\n                For modes that require an initialization vector, it must\n                be 16 bytes or longer (bytes in excess of 16 are\n                ignored). An error occurs if\n                init_vector is missing. For\n                modes that do not require an initialization vector, it\n                is ignored and a warning is generated if\n                init_vector is specified,\n                unless you are using a KDF.\n              \n                The default value for the\n                block_encryption_mode\n                system variable is aes-128-ecb, or\n                ECB mode, which does not require an initialization\n                vector. The alternative permitted block encryption modes\n                CBC, CFB1, CFB8, CFB128, and OFB all require an\n                initialization vector.\n              \n                A random string of bytes to use for the initialization\n                vector can be produced by calling\n                RANDOM_BYTES(16).\n              \nkdf_name\n\n                The name of the key derivation function (KDF) to create\n                a key from the input keying material passed in\n                key_str, and other arguments\n                as appropriate for the KDF. Optional.\n              \n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                kdf_name for encryption with\n                AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT(). When you\n                specify kdf_name, you must\n                specify init_vector, using\n                either a valid initialization vector, or a null string\n                if the encryption mode does not require an\n                initialization vector.\n              \n                The following values are supported:\n\n\n\nhkdf\n\n                      HKDF, which is available from OpenSSL 1.1.0.

With PBKDF2,\n                      you can specify an optional salt\n                      (salt) to include in\n                      the keying material, and set the number of\n                      iterations used to produce the key\n                      (iterations).\n\n\n\n                In this example, HKDF is specified as the key derivation\n                function, and a salt and context information are\n                provided. The argument for the initialization vector is\n                included but is the empty string:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy SELECT AES_ENCRYPT('mytext','mykeystring', '', 'hkdf', 'salt', 'info');\n                In this example, PBKDF2 is specified as the key\n                derivation function, a salt is provided, and the number\n                of iterations is doubled from the recommended minimum:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy SELECT AES_ENCRYPT('mytext','mykeystring', '', 'pbkdf2_hmac','salt', '2000');\nsalt\n\n                A salt to be passed to the key derivation function\n                (KDF). Optional. Both HKDF and PBKDF2 can use salts, and\n                their use is recommended to help prevent attacks based\n                on dictionaries of common passwords or rainbow tables.\n              \n                A salt consists of random data, which for security must\n                be different for each encryption operation. A random\n                string of bytes to use for the salt can be produced by\n                calling RANDOM_BYTES().\n                This example produces a 64-bit salt:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy SET @salt = RANDOM_BYTES(8);\n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                salt for encryption with\n                AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT(). The salt\n                can safely be stored along with the encrypted data.\n              \ninfo\n\n                Context-specific information for HKDF to include in the\n                keying material, such as information about the\n                application. Optional; available when you specify\n                hkdf as the KDF name. HKDF adds this\n                information to the keying material specified in\n                key_str and the salt\n                specified in salt to produce\n                the key.\n              \n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                info for encryption with\n                AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n              \niterations\n\n                The iteration count for PBKDF2 to use when producing the\n                key. Optional; available when you specify\n                pbkdf2_hmac as the KDF name. A higher\n                count gives greater resistance to brute-force attacks\n                because it has a greater computational cost for the\n                attacker, but the same is necessarily true for the key\n                derivation process. The default if you do not specify\n                this argument is 1000, which is the minimum recommended\n                by the OpenSSL standard.\n              \n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                iterations for encryption\n                with AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n\n",
