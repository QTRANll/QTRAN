        "\nBIN_TO_UUID() is the inverse of\n          UUID_TO_BIN(). It converts a\n          binary UUID to a string UUID and returns the result. The\n          binary value should be a UUID as a\n          VARBINARY(16) value. The return\n          value is a string of five hexadecimal numbers separated by\n          dashes. (For details about this format, see the\n          UUID() function description.)\n          If the UUID argument is NULL, the return\n          value is NULL. If any argument is invalid,\n          an error occurs.\n        ",

The string result is in the same order as\n              the binary argument.\n            \n              The two-argument form takes a binary UUID value and a\n              swap-flag value:\n\n\n\n                  If swap_flag is 0, the\n                  two-argument form is equivalent to the one-argument\n                  form.
