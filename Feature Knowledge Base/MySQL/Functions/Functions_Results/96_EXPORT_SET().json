Bits in bits are examined\n          from right to left (from low-order to high-order bits).\n          Strings are added to the result from left to right, separated\n          by the separator string (the\n          default being the comma character ,). The\n          number of bits examined is given by\n          number_of_bits, which has a default\n          of 64 if not specified.\n          number_of_bits is silently clipped\n          to 64 if larger than 64. It is treated as an unsigned integer,\n          so a value of \u22121 is effectively the same as 64.\n        ",
