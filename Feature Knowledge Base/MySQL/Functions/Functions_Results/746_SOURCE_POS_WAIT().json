        "\n            The return value is the number of log events the replica had\n            to wait for to advance to the specified position. The\n            function returns NULL if the replication\n            SQL thread is not started, the replica's source information\n            is not initialized, the arguments are incorrect, or an error\n            occurs. It returns -1 if the timeout has\n            been exceeded. If the replication SQL thread stops while\n            SOURCE_POS_WAIT() is waiting,\n            the function returns NULL.

The\n            binary log file position can be marked as invalid when the\n            CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO\n            option GTID_ONLY is set for the\n            replication channel, and the server is restarted or\n            replication is stopped. The file position becomes valid\n            after a transaction is successfully applied past the given\n            file position. If the applier does not reach the stated\n            position, the function waits until the timeout. Use a\n            SHOW REPLICA STATUS statement\n            to check if the binary log file position has been marked as\n            invalid.\n          ",
