        "\n            In MySQL, you can get the concatenated values of expression\n            combinations. To eliminate duplicate values, use the\n            DISTINCT clause. To sort values in the\n            result, use the ORDER BY clause. To sort\n            in reverse order, add the DESC\n            (descending) keyword to the name of the column you are\n            sorting by in the ORDER BY clause. The\n            default is ascending order; this may be specified explicitly\n            using the ASC keyword. The default\n            separator between values in a group is comma\n            (,). To specify a separator explicitly,\n            use SEPARATOR followed by the string\n            literal value that should be inserted between group values.\n            To eliminate the separator altogether, specify\n            SEPARATOR ''.\n          ",
        "\n            The result is truncated to the maximum length that is given\n            by the group_concat_max_len\n            system variable, which has a default value of 1024. The\n            value can be set higher, although the effective maximum\n            length of the return value is constrained by the value of\n            max_allowed_packet. The\n            syntax to change the value of\n            group_concat_max_len at\n            runtime is as follows, where val\n            is an unsigned integer:\n          ",
