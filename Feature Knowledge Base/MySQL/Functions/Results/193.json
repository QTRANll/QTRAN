        "\n          Returns the length of the string\n          str, measured in bytes. A multibyte\n          character counts as multiple bytes. This means that for a\n          string containing five 2-byte characters,\n          LENGTH() returns\n          10, whereas\n          CHAR_LENGTH() returns\n          5. Returns NULL if\n          str is NULL.\n        ",
