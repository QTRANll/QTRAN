However, when the database compresses the database, this difference is amplified. This amplification is due to the minutes and seconds in DateTime being less compressible. Filtering and aggregating Date instead of DateTime is also faster.", "Usage Remarks\u200b", "The point in time is saved as a Unix timestamp, regardless of the time zone or daylight saving time.
