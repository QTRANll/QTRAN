The common way to produce an aggregate function state is by calling the aggregate function with the -State suffix. To get the final result of aggregation in the future, you must use the same aggregate function with the -Mergesuffix.", "AggregateFunction(name, types_of_arguments...) \u2014 parametric data type.", "Parameters", "Name of the aggregate function.
