        "Calculates the number of different values of the argument up to a specified limit, N. If the number of different argument values is greater than N, this function returns N + 1, otherwise it calculates the exact value.",
        "Recommended for use with small Ns, up to 10. The maximum value of N is 100.",
        "For the state of an aggregate function, this function uses the amount of memory equal to 1 + N * the size of one value of bytes.\nWhen dealing with strings, this function stores a non-cryptographic hash of 8 bytes; the calculation is approximated for strings.",
        "For example, if you had a table that logs every search query made by users on your website. Each row in the table represents a single search query, with columns for the user ID, the search query, and the timestamp of the query. You can use uniqUpTo to generate a report that shows only the keywords that produced at least 5 unique users.",
        "SELECT SearchPhraseFROM SearchLogGROUP BY SearchPhraseHAVING uniqUpTo(4)(UserID) >= 5",
        "uniqUpTo(4)(UserID) calculates the number of unique UserID values for each SearchPhrase, but it only counts up to 4 unique values. If there are more than 4 unique UserID values for a SearchPhrase, the function returns 5 (4 + 1). The HAVING clause then filters out the SearchPhrase values for which the number of unique UserID values is less than 5. This will give you a list of search keywords that were used by at least 5 unique users."
