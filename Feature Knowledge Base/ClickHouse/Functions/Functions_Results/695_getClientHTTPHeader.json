        "Get the value of an HTTP header.",

        "The function requires the setting allow_get_client_http_header to be enabled.\nThe setting is not enabled by default for security reasons, because some headers, such as Cookie, could contain sensitive info.",
        "HTTP headers are case sensitive for this function.",
        "If the function is used in the context of a distributed query, it returns non-empty result only on the initiator node."
