    "Feature": [
        "runningDifference(x)"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "runningDifference",
        "Calculates the difference between two consecutive row values in the data block.\nReturns 0 for the first row, and for subsequent rows the difference to the previous row.",
        "NoteOnly returns differences inside the currently processed data block.\nBecause of this error-prone behavior the function is DEPRECATED, please use proper window functions instead.",
        "The result of the function depends on the affected data blocks and the order of data in the block.",
        "The order of rows during calculation of runningDifference() can differ from the order of rows returned to the user.\nTo prevent that you can create a subquery with ORDER BY and call the function from outside the subquery.",

        "runningDifference(x)"
