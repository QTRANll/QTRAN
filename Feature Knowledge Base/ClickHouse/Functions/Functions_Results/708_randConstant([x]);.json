    "Feature": [
        "randConstant([x]);"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "randConstant",
        "Generates a single constant column filled with a random value. Unlike rand, this function ensures the same random value appears in every row of the generated column, making it useful for scenarios requiring a consistent random seed across rows in a single query.",
        "Syntax",
        "randConstant([x]);",
        "Arguments",
        "[x] (Optional): An optional expression that influences the generated random value. Even if provided, the resulting value will still be constant within the same query execution. Different queries using the same expression will likely generate different constant values.",
        "Returned value",
        "Returns a column of type UInt32 containing the same random value in each row.",
        "Implementation details",
        "The actual output will be different for each query execution, even with the same optional expression. The optional parameter may not significantly change the generated value compared to using randConstant alone."
