        "x is each individual data point in the data set.mean(x) is the arithmetic mean of the data set.n is the number of data points in the data set.",
        "The function assumes that the input data set represents a sample from a larger population. If you want to calculate the variance of the entire population (when you have the complete data set), you should use varPop instead."
