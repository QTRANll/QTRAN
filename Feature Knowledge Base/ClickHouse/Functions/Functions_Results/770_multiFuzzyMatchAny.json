    "Description": [
        "multiFuzzyMatchAny",
        "Like multiMatchAny but returns 1 if any pattern matches the haystack within a constant edit distance. This function relies on the experimental feature of hyperscan library, and can be slow for some corner cases. The performance depends on the edit distance value and patterns used, but it's always more expensive compared to a non-fuzzy variants.",
        "NotemultiFuzzyMatch*() function family do not support UTF-8 regular expressions (it threats them as a sequence of bytes) due to restrictions of hyperscan.",
