    "Description": [
        "cramersV",
        "Cramer's V (sometimes referred to as Cramer's phi) is a measure of association between two columns in a table. The result of the cramersV function ranges from 0 (corresponding to no association between the variables) to 1 and can reach 1 only when each value is completely determined by the other. It may be viewed as the association between two variables as a percentage of their maximum possible variation.",

        "Syntax",

        "column1: first column to be compared.column2: second column to be compared.",
        "Returned value",
        "a value between 0 (corresponding to no association between the columns' values) to 1 (complete association).",
