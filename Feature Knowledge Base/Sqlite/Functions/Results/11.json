        "\n  The instr(X,Y) function finds the first occurrence of string Y within \n  string X and returns the number of prior characters plus 1, or 0 if\n  Y is nowhere found within X.\n  Or, if X and Y are both BLOBs, then instr(X,Y) returns one\n  more than the number bytes prior to the first occurrence of Y, or 0 if\n  Y does not occur anywhere within X.\n  If both arguments X and Y to instr(X,Y) are non-NULL and are not BLOBs\n  then both are interpreted as strings.\n  If either X or Y are NULL in instr(X,Y) then the result is NULL.\n"
