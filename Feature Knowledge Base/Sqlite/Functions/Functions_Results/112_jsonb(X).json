    "Description": [
        "The jsonb(X) function is designed to return the binary JSONB representation of the JSON content provided in argument X. If the argument X is a TEXT string that does not adhere to valid JSON syntax, the function will raise an error. In cases where X is a BLOB that resembles JSONB, the function will return a copy of X, but it is important to note that only the outer-most element is examined, and the internal structure of the JSONB is not thoroughly validated."
