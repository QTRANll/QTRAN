    "Description": [
        "The jsonb_object() function is analogous to the json_object() function, with a key difference in the format of the output. While json_object() constructs and returns a JSON object in the standard text format, jsonb_object() generates the object in the binary JSONB format. This binary format can offer performance benefits for certain operations involving JSON data in SQLite, as it may reduce parsing time and improve data handling efficiency within the database."
