    "Description": [
        "The jsonb_insert(), jsonb_replace(), and jsonb_set() functions operate in a manner analogous to their json_ counterparts, specifically json_insert(), json_replace(), and json_set(). These binary JSONB format functions are designed to perform the same JSON value modifications as their text-based counterparts, with the key distinction that they return the results in the binary JSONB format. This can be advantageous for performance and efficiency when working with JSON data in SQLite, as the binary format reduces the overhead associated with parsing and handling JSON text."
