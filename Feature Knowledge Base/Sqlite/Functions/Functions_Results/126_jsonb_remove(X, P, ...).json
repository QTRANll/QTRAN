    "Description": [
        "The jsonb_remove() function operates in a similar fashion to the json_remove() function, with a key difference in the format of the returned result. It takes a JSON value as its first argument, followed by one or more path arguments that specify which elements to remove from the JSON. The function returns a copy of the JSON with the specified elements removed, in the binary JSONB format. If a path does not match any element, it is ignored without error. The removal process is sequential and can affect the outcome of subsequent path arguments. If called without path arguments, jsonb_remove() returns the input JSON reformatted with excess whitespace removed. The function will throw an error if the initial argument is not well-formed JSON or if any path argument is not a well-formed path."
