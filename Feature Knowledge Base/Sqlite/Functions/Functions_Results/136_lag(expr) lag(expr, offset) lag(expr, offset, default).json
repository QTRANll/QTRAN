    "Description": [
        "The first form of the lag() function returns the result of evaluating expression expr against the previous row in the partition. Or, if there is no previous row (because the current row is the first), NULL.",
        "If the offset argument is provided, then it must be a non-negative integer. In this case the value returned is the result of evaluating expr against the row offset rows before the current row within the partition. If offset is 0, then expr is evaluated against the current row. If there is no row offset rows before the current row, NULL is returned.",
        "If default is also provided, then it is returned instead of NULL if the row identified by offset does not exist."
