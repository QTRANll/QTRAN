        "json(X)"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "The json(X) function checks if the provided argument X is a valid JSON string or JSONB blob. If valid, it returns a minified version of the JSON string, removing all unnecessary whitespace. In cases where the input X is not well-formed, the function throws an error. The function also ensures that any JSON5 text is converted into the canonical RFC-8259 format before being returned. It is important to note that the handling of JSON objects with duplicate labels within the argument X is currently such that duplicates are preserved; however, this behavior might change in future updates of the function, possibly with silent removal of duplicates."
