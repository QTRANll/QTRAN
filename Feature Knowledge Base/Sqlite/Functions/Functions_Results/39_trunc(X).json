        "Return the representable integer in between X and 0 (inclusive)\n  that is furthest away from zero.  Or, in other words, return the\n  integer part of X, rounding toward zero.\n  The trunc() function is similar toceiling(X)andfloor(X)except\n  that it always rounds toward zero whereas ceiling(X) and floor(X) round\n  up and down, respectively."
