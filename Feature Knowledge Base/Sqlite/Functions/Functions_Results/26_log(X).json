    "Description": [
        "Return the base-10 logarithm for X.  Or, for the two-argument version,\n  return the base-B logarithm of X.Compatibility note:  SQLite works like PostgreSQL in that the log() function\n  computes a base-10 logarithm.  Most other SQL database engines compute a\n  natural logarithm for log().  In the two-argument version of log(B,X), the\n  first argument is the base and the second argument is the operand.  This is\n  the same as in PostgreSQL and MySQL, but is reversed from SQL Server which\n  uses the second argument as the base and the first argument as the operand."
