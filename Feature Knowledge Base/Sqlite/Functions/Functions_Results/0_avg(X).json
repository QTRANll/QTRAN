        "The avg() function\n  returns the average value of all non-NULLXwithin a\n  group.  String and BLOB values that do not look like numbers are\n  interpreted as 0.\n  The result of avg() is always a floating point value whenever\n  there is at least one non-NULL input even if all\n  inputs are integers.  The result of avg() is NULL if\n  there are no non-NULL inputs.  The result of avg() is computed\n  astotal()/count()so all of the constraints that apply tototal()also apply to avg()."
