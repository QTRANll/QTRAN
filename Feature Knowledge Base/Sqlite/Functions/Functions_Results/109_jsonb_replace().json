    "Description": [
        "The jsonb_insert(), jsonb_replace(), and jsonb_set() functions operate analogously to their json_ prefixed counterparts, namely json_insert(), json_replace(), and json_set(). These jsonb_ prefixed functions are designed to manipulate JSON data, allowing for insertion, replacement, and setting of values at specified paths within a JSON object. A key distinction, however, is that the jsonb_ versions return their results in the binary JSONB format, which can offer performance optimizations for operations involving JSON data in SQLite. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with a series of JSON data manipulations, as the binary format can reduce the overhead associated with parsing and converting JSON text."
