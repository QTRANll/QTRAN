    "Description": [
        "The hex() function interprets its argument as a BLOB and returns\n  a string which is the upper-case hexadecimal rendering of the content of\n  that blob.If the argumentXin \"hex(X)\" is an\n  integer or floating point number, then \"interprets its argument as a BLOB\" means\n  that the binary number is first converted into a UTF8 text representation, then\n  that text is interpreted as a BLOB.  Hence, \"hex(12345678)\" renders\n  as \"3132333435363738\" not the binary representation of the integer value\n  \"0000000000BC614E\".See also:unhex()"
