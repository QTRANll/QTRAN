    "Description": [
        "The jsonb_insert(), jsonb_replace(), and jsonb_set() functions operate similarly to their json_ counterparts, such as json_insert(), json_replace(), and json_set(), respectively. The key difference is that the jsonb_ prefixed versions of these functions return their results in the binary JSONB format, which can offer performance benefits for certain operations that involve JSON data in SQLite."
