        "The unlikely(X) function returns the argument X unchanged.\n  The unlikely(X) function is a no-op that the code generator\n  optimizes away so that it consumes no CPU cycles at\n  run-time (that is, during calls tosqlite3_step()).\n  The purpose of the unlikely(X) function is to provide a hint\n  to the query planner that the argument X is a boolean value\n  that is usually not true. The unlikely(X) function is equivalent\n  tolikelihood(X, 0.0625)."
