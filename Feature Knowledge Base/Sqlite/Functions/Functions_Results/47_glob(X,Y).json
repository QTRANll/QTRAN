    "Description": [
        "The glob(X,Y) function is equivalent to the\n  expression \"Y GLOB X\".\n  Note that the X and Y arguments are reversed in the glob() function\n  relative to the infixGLOBoperator.  Y is the string and X is the\n  pattern.  So, for example, the following expressions are equivalent:If thesqlite3_create_function()interface is used to\n  override the glob(X,Y) function with an alternative implementation then\n  theGLOBoperator will invoke the alternative implementation."
