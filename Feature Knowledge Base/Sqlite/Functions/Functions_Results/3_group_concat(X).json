    "Description": [
        "The group_concat() function returns\n  a string which is the concatenation of\n  all non-NULL values ofX.  If parameterYis present then\n  it is used as the separator\n  between instances ofX.A comma (\",\") is used as the separator\n  ifYis omitted.The string_agg(X,Y) function is an alias\n  for group_concat(X,Y).  String_agg() is compatible with PostgreSQL\n  and SQL-Server and group_concat() is compatible with MySQL.The order of the concatenated elements is arbitrary unless an\n  ORDER BY argument is included immediately after the last parameter."
