    ],
    "Description": [
        "The jsonb_patch() function operates similarly to the json_patch() function, with a primary distinction in the format of the output. It implements the RFC-7396 MergePatch algorithm to apply a patch P to an input JSON object T. However, unlike json_patch(), which returns the patched JSON in text format, jsonb_patch() returns the patched JSON in the binary JSONB format. This binary format can offer performance improvements for applications that require efficient handling of JSON data within SQLite."
