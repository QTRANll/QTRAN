        "Despite the name, this function always returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0 equal to (rank - 1)/(partition-rows - 1), where rank is the value returned by built-in window function rank() and partition-rows is the total number of rows in the partition. If the partition contains only one row, this function returns 0.0."
