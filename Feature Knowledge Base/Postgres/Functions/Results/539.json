    "Description": [
        "Returns changes in the slot slot_name, starting from the point from which changes have been consumed last. If upto_lsn and upto_nchanges are NULL, logical decoding will continue until end of WAL. If upto_lsn is non-NULL, decoding will include only those transactions which commit prior to the specified LSN. If upto_nchanges is non-NULL, decoding will stop when the number of rows produced by decoding exceeds the specified value. Note, however, that the actual number of rows returned may be larger, since this limit is only checked after adding the rows produced when decoding each new transaction commit."
