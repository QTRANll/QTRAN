    "Description": [
        "Returns information about the progress of the WAL summarizer. If the WAL summarizer has never run since the instance was started, then summarized_tli and summarized_lsn will be 0 and 0/0 respectively; otherwise, they will be the TLI and ending LSN of the last WAL summary file written to disk. If the WAL summarizer is currently running, pending_lsn will be the ending LSN of the last record that it has consumed, which must always be greater than or equal to summarized_lsn; if the WAL summarizer is not running, it will be equal to summarized_lsn. summarizer_pid is the PID of the WAL summarizer process, if it is running, and otherwise NULL.",
        "As a special exception, the WAL summarizer will refuse to generate WAL summary files if run on WAL generated under wal_level=minimal, since such summaries would be unsafe to use as the basis for an incremental backup. In this case, the fields above will continue to advance as if summaries were being generated, but nothing will be written to disk. Once the summarizer reaches WAL generated while wal_level was set to replica or higher, it will resume writing summaries to disk."
