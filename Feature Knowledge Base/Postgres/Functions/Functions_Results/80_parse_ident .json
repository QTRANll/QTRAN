    "Feature": [
        "parse_ident ( qualified_identifier text [, strict_mode boolean DEFAULT true ] ) → text[]"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "Splits qualified_identifier into an array of identifiers, removing any quoting of individual identifiers. By default, extra characters after the last identifier are considered an error; but if the second parameter is false, then such extra characters are ignored. (This behavior is useful for parsing names for objects like functions.) Note that this function does not truncate over-length identifiers. If you want truncation you can cast the result to name[]."
