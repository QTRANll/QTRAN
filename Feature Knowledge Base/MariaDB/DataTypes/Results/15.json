    "Description": [
        "A BLOB column with a maximum length of 65,535 (216 - 1) bytes. Each\nBLOB value is stored using a two-byte length prefix that indicates the\nnumber of bytes in the value.",
        "An optional length M can be given for this type. If this is done,\nMariaDB creates the column as the smallest BLOB type large enough to\nhold values M bytes long.",
        "BLOBS can also be used to store dynamic columns.",
        "BLOB and TEXT columns can both be assigned a DEFAULT value.",
        "Indexing",
        "MariaDB starting with 10.4From MariaDB 10.4, it is possible to set a unique index on a column that uses the BLOB data type.  In previous releases this was not possible, as the index would only guarantee the uniqueness of a fixed number of characters.\n",
        "Oracle Mode",
        "In Oracle mode from MariaDB 10.3, BLOB is a synonym for LONGBLOB."
