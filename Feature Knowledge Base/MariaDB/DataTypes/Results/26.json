    "Description": [
        "A TEXT column with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 or 4GB (232 - 1) characters. The effective maximum length is less if the value contains multi-byte characters. The effective maximum length of LONGTEXT columns also depends on the configured maximum packet size in the client/server protocol and available memory. Each LONGTEXT value is stored using a four-byte length prefix that indicates the number of bytes in the value.",
        "From MariaDB 10.2.7, JSON is an alias for LONGTEXT. See JSON Data Type for details."
