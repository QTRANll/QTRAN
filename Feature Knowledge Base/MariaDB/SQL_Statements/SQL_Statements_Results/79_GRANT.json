        "To mitigate this concern, MariaDB allows you to encrypt data in transit between the server and clients using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS was formerly known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL), but strictly speaking the SSL protocol is a predecessor to TLS and, that version of the protocol is now considered insecure. The documentation still uses the term SSL often and for compatibility reasons TLS-related server system and status variables still use the prefix ssl_, but internally, MariaDB only supports its secure successors.",

For instance, you might use this with user accounts that require access to sensitive data while sending it across networks that you do not control.

This option can be combined with the ISSUER, and CIPHER options in any order.\nREQUIRE CIPHER 'cipher'The account must use TLS, but no valid X509 certificate is required. Also, the encryption used for the connection must use a specific cipher method specified in the string cipher. This option implies REQUIRE SSL. This option can be combined with the ISSUER, and SUBJECT options in any order.\n\n",
        "The REQUIRE keyword must be used only once for all specified options, and the AND keyword can be used to separate individual options, but it is not required.",
