    ],
    "Feature": [
        "SHOW [STORAGE] ENGINES\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "SHOW ENGINES displays status information about the server's\nstorage engines. This is particularly useful for checking whether a storage\nengine is supported, or to see what the default engine is. \nSHOW TABLE TYPES is a deprecated synonym.",
        "The information_schema.ENGINES table provides the same information.",
        "Since storage engines are plugins, different information about them is also shown in the information_schema.PLUGINS table and by the SHOW PLUGINS statement.",
        "Note that both MySQL's InnoDB and Percona's XtraDB replacement are labeled as InnoDB.  However, if XtraDB is in use, it will be specified in the COMMENT field. See XtraDB and InnoDB. The same applies to FederatedX.",
        "The output consists of the following columns:",
        "Engine indicates the engine's name.\nSupport indicates whether the engine is installed, and whether it is the default engine for the current session.\nComment is a brief description.\nTransactions, XA and Savepoints indicate whether transactions, XA transactions and transaction savepoints are supported by the engine.\n"
