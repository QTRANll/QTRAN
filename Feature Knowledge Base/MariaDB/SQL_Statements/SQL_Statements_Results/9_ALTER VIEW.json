    "Description": [
        "This statement changes the definition of a view, which must exist. The\nsyntax is similar to that for CREATE VIEW and the effect is the same\nas for CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW if the view exists. This statement\nrequires the CREATE VIEW and DROP privileges for the view, and some\nprivilege for each column referred to in the SELECT statement. ALTER VIEW is allowed only to the definer or users with the SUPER privilege."
