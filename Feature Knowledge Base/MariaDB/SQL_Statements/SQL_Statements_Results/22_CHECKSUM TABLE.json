    ],
    "Description": [
        "CHECKSUM TABLE reports a table checksum.  This is very\nuseful if you want to know if two tables are the same (for example on a master\nand slave).",
        "With QUICK, the live table checksum is reported if it is\navailable, or NULL otherwise. This is very fast. A live\nchecksum is enabled by specifying the CHECKSUM=1 table\noption when you create the table; currently, this is supported\nonly for Aria and MyISAM tables.",
        "With EXTENDED, the entire table is read row by row and the\nchecksum is calculated. This can be very slow for large tables.",
        "If neither QUICK nor EXTENDED is\nspecified, MariaDB returns a live checksum if the table storage engine supports\nit and scans the table otherwise.",
        "CHECKSUM TABLE requires the SELECT privilege for the table.",
        "For a nonexistent table, CHECKSUM TABLE returns\nNULL and generates a warning.",
        "The table row format affects the checksum value. If the row format changes, the checksum will change. This means that when a table created with a MariaDB/MySQL version is upgraded to another version, the checksum value will probably change.",
        "Two identical tables should always match to the same checksum value; however, also for non-identical tables there is a very slight chance that they will return the same value as the hashing algorithm is not completely collision-free."
