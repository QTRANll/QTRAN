        "The CREATE USER statement creates new MariaDB accounts. To use it, you must have the global CREATE USER privilege or the INSERT privilege for the mysql database. For each account, CREATE USER creates a new row in mysql.user (until MariaDB 10.3 this is a table, from MariaDB 10.4 it's a view) or mysql.global_priv_table (from MariaDB 10.4) that has no privileges.",
        "If any of the specified accounts, or any permissions for the specified accounts, already exist, then the server returns ERROR 1396 (HY000). If an error occurs, CREATE USER will still create the accounts that do not result in an error. Only one error is produced for all users which have not been created:",
