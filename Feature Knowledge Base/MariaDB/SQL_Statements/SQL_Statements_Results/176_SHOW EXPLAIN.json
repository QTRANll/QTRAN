        "Differences Between SHOW EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN Outputs",
        "Background",
        "In MySQL, EXPLAIN execution takes a slightly different route from the way\nthe real query (typically the SELECT) is optimized. This is unfortunate,\nand has caused a number of bugs in EXPLAIN. (For example, see\nMDEV-326, MDEV-410, and\nlp:1013343.\nlp:992942 is not directly\nabout EXPLAIN, but it also would not have existed if MySQL didn't try to delete\nparts of a query plan in the middle of the query) ",
        "SHOW EXPLAIN examines a running SELECT, and hence its output may be\nslightly different from what EXPLAIN SELECT would produce. We did our best\nto make sure that either the difference is negligible, or SHOW EXPLAIN's\noutput is closer to reality than EXPLAIN's output.",
        "List of Recorded Differences",
        "SHOW EXPLAIN may have Extra='no matching row in const table', where  EXPLAIN would produce Extra='Impossible WHERE ...'\nFor queries with subqueries, SHOW EXPLAIN may print select_type==PRIMARY where regular EXPLAIN used to print select_type==SIMPLE, or vice versa.\n",
        "Required Permissions",
        "Running SHOW EXPLAIN requires the same permissions as running SHOW PROCESSLIST would."
