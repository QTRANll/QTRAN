    "Description": [
        "DROP INDEX drops the index named index_name from the table tbl_name.\nThis statement is mapped to an ALTER TABLE statement to drop the\nindex.",
        "If another connection is using the table, a metadata lock is active, and this statement will wait until the lock is released. This is also true for non-transactional tables.",
        "See ALTER TABLE.",
        "Another shortcut, CREATE INDEX, allows the creation of an index.",
        "To remove the primary key, `PRIMARY` must be specified as index_name. Note that the quotes are necessary, because PRIMARY is a keyword."
