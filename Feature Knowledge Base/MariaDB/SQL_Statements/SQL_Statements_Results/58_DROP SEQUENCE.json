    "Description": [
        "DROP SEQUENCE removes one or more sequences created with CREATE SEQUENCE. You must have the DROP privilege for each sequence. MariaDB returns an error indicating by name which non-existing tables it was unable to drop, but it also drops all of the tables in the list that do exist.",
        "Important: When a table is dropped, user privileges on the table are not automatically dropped. See GRANT.",
        "If another connection is using the sequence, a metadata lock is active, and this statement will wait until the lock is released. This is also true for non-transactional tables.",
        "For each referenced sequence, DROP SEQUENCE drops a temporary sequence with that name, if it exists. If it does not exist, and the TEMPORARY keyword is not used, it drops a non-temporary sequence with the same name, if it exists. The TEMPORARY keyword ensures that a non-temporary sequence will not accidentally be dropped.",
        "Use IF EXISTS to prevent an error from occurring for sequences that do not exist. A NOTE is generated for each non-existent sequence when using IF EXISTS. See SHOW WARNINGS.",
        "DROP SEQUENCE requires the DROP privilege."
