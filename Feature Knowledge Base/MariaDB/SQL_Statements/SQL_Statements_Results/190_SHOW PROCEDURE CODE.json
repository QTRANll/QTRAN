    "Description": [
        "This statement is a MariaDB extension that is available only for servers that\nhave been built with debugging support. It displays a representation of the\ninternal implementation of the named stored procedure. A similar statement,\n SHOW FUNCTION CODE, displays\ninformation about stored functions.",
        "Both statements require that you be the owner of the routine or have\n SELECT access to the mysql.proc table.",
        "If the named routine is available, each statement produces a result\nset. Each row in the result set corresponds to one \"instruction\" in\nthe routine. The first column is Pos, which is an ordinal number\nbeginning with 0. The second column is Instruction, which contains an\nSQL statement (usually changed from the original source), or a\ndirective which has meaning only to the stored-routine handler."
