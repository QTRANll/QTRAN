    "Description": [
        "A user-defined function (UDF) is a way to extend MariaDB with a new function\nthat works like a native (built-in) MariaDB function such as ABS() or\nCONCAT().",
        "function_name is the name that should be used in SQL statements to invoke\nthe function. ",
        "To create a function, you must have the INSERT privilege for the\nmysql database. This is necessary becauseCREATE FUNCTION adds a row to the\nmysql.func system table that records the function's name,\ntype, and shared library name. If you do not have this table, you should run\nthe mariadb-upgrade command to create it.",
        "UDFs need to be written in C, C++ or another language that uses C calling\nconventions, MariaDB needs to have been dynamically compiled, and your\noperating system must support dynamic loading.",
        "For an example, see sql/udf_example.cc in the source tree. For a collection of existing UDFs see http://www.mysqludf.org/.",
        "Statements making use of user-defined functions are not\nsafe for replication.",
        "For creating a stored function as opposed to a user-defined function, see\nCREATE FUNCTION.",
        "For valid identifiers to use as function names, see Identifier Names.",
        "RETURNS",
        "The RETURNS clause indicates the type of the function's\nreturn value, and can be one of STRING, INTEGER, REAL or DECIMAL. DECIMAL functions currently return string values and should be written like STRING functions.",
        "shared_library_name",
        "shared_library_name is the basename of the shared object file that contains\nthe code that implements the function. The file must be located in the plugin\ndirectory. This directory is given by the value of the\nplugin_dir system variable. Note that\nbefore MariaDB/MySQL 5.1, the shared object could be located in any directory\nthat was searched by your system's dynamic linker.",
        "AGGREGATE",
        "Aggregate functions are summary functions such as SUM() and\nAVG().\nAggregate UDF functions can be used as window functions.",
        "OR REPLACE",
        "If the optional OR REPLACE clause is used, it acts as a shortcut for:",
        "DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS function_name;\nCREATE FUNCTION name ...;\n",
        "IF NOT EXISTS",
        "When the IF NOT EXISTS clause is used, MariaDB will return a warning instead of an error if the specified function already exists. Cannot be used together with OR REPLACE.",
        "Upgrading a UDF",
        "To upgrade the UDF's shared library, first run a\nDROP FUNCTION statement, then upgrade the shared library and\nfinally run the CREATE FUNCTION statement. If you upgrade without following\nthis process, you may crash the server.",
        "Examples",
