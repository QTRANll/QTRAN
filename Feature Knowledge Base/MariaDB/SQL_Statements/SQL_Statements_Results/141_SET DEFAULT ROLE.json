    "Feature": [
        "SET DEFAULT ROLE { role | NONE } [ FOR user@host ]\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "The SET DEFAULT ROLE statement sets a default role for a specified (or current) user. A default role is automatically enabled when a user connects (an implicit SET ROLE statement is executed immediately after a connection is established).",
        "To be able to set a role as a default, the role must already have been granted to that user, and one needs the privileges to enable this role (if you cannot do SET ROLE X, you won't be able to do SET DEFAULT ROLE X). To set a default role for another user one needs to have write access to the mysql database.",
        "To remove a user's default role, use SET DEFAULT ROLE NONE [ FOR user@host ]. The record of the default role is not removed if the role is dropped or revoked, so if the role is subsequently re-created or granted, it will again be the user's default role.",
        "The default role is stored in the default_role column in the mysql.user table/view, as well as in the Information Schema APPLICABLE_ROLES table, so these can be viewed to see which role has been assigned to a user as the default. "
