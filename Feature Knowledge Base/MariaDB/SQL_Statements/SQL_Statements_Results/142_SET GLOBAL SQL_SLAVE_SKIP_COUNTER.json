    "Description": [
        "This statement skips the next N events from the primary. This is useful\nfor recovering from replication stops caused by a statement.",
        "If multi-source replication is used, this statement applies to the default connection. It could be necessary to change the value of the default_master_connection system variable.",
        "Note that, if the event is a transaction, the whole transaction will be skipped. With non-transactional engines, an event is always a single statement.",
        "This statement is valid only when the replica threads are not running.\nOtherwise, it produces an error.",
        "The statement does not automatically restart the replica threads."
