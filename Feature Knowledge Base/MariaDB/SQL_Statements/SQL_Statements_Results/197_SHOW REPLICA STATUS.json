    "Description": [
        "This statement is to be run on a replica and provides status information on essential parameters of the replica threads.",
        "This statement requires the SUPER privilege, the REPLICATION_CLIENT privilege, or, from MariaDB 10.5.2, the REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN privilege, or, from MariaDB 10.5.9, the REPLICA MONITOR privilege.",
        "Multi-Source",
        "The ALL and \"connection_name\" options allow you to connect to many primaries at the same time.",
        "ALL SLAVES (or ALL REPLICAS from MariaDB 10.5.1) gives you a list of all connections to the primary nodes.",
        "The rows will be sorted according to Connection_name.",
        "If you specify a connection_name, you only get the information about that\nconnection. If connection_name is not used, then the name set by default_master_connection is used. If the connection name doesn't exist you will get an error:\nThere is no master connection for 'xxx'.",
        "MariaDB starting with 10.7.0The FOR CHANNEL keyword was added for MySQL compatibility. This is identical to\nusing the channel_name directly after SHOW SLAVE.\n",
        "Column Descriptions",
        "The order in which the columns appear depends on the MariaDB version. This means that extracting a column value is best done by comparing the field name instead of using a fixed offset into the row.",
        "NameDescription\nConnection_nameName of the primary connection. Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS (or SHOW ALL REPLICAS STATUS from MariaDB 10.5.1) only.\nSlave_SQL_StateState of SQL thread.

Added in MariaDB 10.11\nReplicate_Do_DBDatabases specified for replicating with the replicate_do_db option.\nReplicate_Ignore_DBDatabases specified for ignoring with the replicate_ignore_db option.\nReplicate_Do_TableTables specified for replicating with the replicate_do_table option.\nReplicate_Ignore_TableTables specified for ignoring with the replicate_ignore_table option.\nReplicate_Wild_Do_TableTables specified for replicating with the replicate_wild_do_table option.\nReplicate_Wild_Ignore_TableTables specified for ignoring with the replicate_wild_ignore_table option.\nLast_ErrnoAlias for Last_SQL_Errno (see below)\nLast ErrorAlias for Last_SQL_Error (see below)\nSkip_CounterNumber of events that a replica skips from the master, as recorded in the sql_slave_skip_counter system variable.\nExec_Master_Log_PosPosition up to which the SQL thread has processed in the current master binary log file. Can be used to start a new replica from a current replica with the CHANGE MASTER TO ... MASTER_LOG_POS option.\nRelay_Log_SpaceTotal size of all relay log files combined.\nUntil_Condition\nUntil_Log_FileThe MASTER_LOG_FILE value of the START SLAVE UNTIL condition.\nUntil_Log_PosThe MASTER_LOG_POS value of the START SLAVE UNTIL condition.\nMaster_SSL_AllowedWhether an SSL connection is permitted (Yes), not permitted (No) or permitted but without the replica having SSL support enabled (Ignored)\nMaster_SSL_CA_FileThe MASTER_SSL_CA option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nMaster_SSL_CA_PathThe MASTER_SSL_CAPATH option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nMaster_SSL_CertThe MASTER_SSL_CERT option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nMaster_SSL_CipherThe MASTER_SSL_CIPHER option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nMaster_SSL_KeyThe MASTER_SSL_KEY option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nSeconds_Behind_MasterDifference between the timestamp logged on the master for the event that the replica is currently processing, and the current timestamp on the replica. Zero if the replica is not currently processing an event. With serial replication, seconds_behind_master is updated when the SQL thread begins executing a transaction. With parallel replication, seconds_behind_master is updated only after transactions commit. Starting in MariaDB 10.3.38, 10.4.28, 10.5.19, 10.6.12, 10.8.7, 10.9.5, 10.10.3, and 10.11.2, an exception is drawn on the parallel replica to additionally update seconds_behind_master when the first transaction received after idling is queued to a worker for execution, to provide a reliable initial value for the duration until a transaction commits. Additional behaviors to be aware of are as follows: 1) Seconds_Behind_Master will update for ignored events, e.g. those skipped due to sql_slave_skip_counter. 2) On the serial replica, transactions with prior timestamps can update Seconds_Behind_Master such that it can go backwards, though this is not true for the parallel replica. 3) When configured with MASTER_DELAY, as a replicated transaction begins executing (i.e. on a serial or post-idle parallel replica), Seconds_Behind_Master will update before delaying, and while delaying occurs will grow to encompass the configured value. 4) There is a known issue, tracked by MDEV-17516, such that Seconds_Behind_Master will initially present as 0 on replica restart until a replicated transaction begins executing, even if the last replica session was lagging behind when stopped.\nMaster_SSL_Verify_Server_CertThe MASTER_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nLast_IO_ErrnoError code of the most recent error that caused the I/O thread to stop (also recorded in the replica's error log). 0 means no error. RESET SLAVE or RESET MASTER will reset this value.\nLast_IO_ErrorError message of the most recent error that caused the I/O thread to stop (also recorded in the replica's error log). An empty string means no error. RESET SLAVE or RESET MASTER will reset this value.\nLast_SQL_ErrnoError code of the most recent error that caused the SQL thread to stop (also recorded in the replica's error log). 0 means no error. RESET SLAVE or RESET MASTER will reset this value.\nLast_SQL_ErrorError message of the most recent error that caused the SQL thread to stop (also recorded in the replica's error log). An empty string means no error. RESET SLAVE or RESET MASTER will reset this value.\nReplicate_Ignore_Server_IdsList of server_ids that are currently being ignored for replication purposes, or an empty string for none, as specified in the IGNORE_SERVER_IDS option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nMaster_Server_IdThe master's server_id value.\nMaster_SSL_CrlThe MASTER_SSL_CRL option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nMaster_SSL_CrlpathThe MASTER_SSL_CRLPATH option of the CHANGE MASTER TO statement.\nUsing_GtidWhether or not global transaction ID's are being used for replication (can be No, Slave_Pos, or Current_Pos).\nGtid_IO_PosCurrent global transaction ID value.\nRetried_transactionsNumber of retried transactions for this connection. Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS only.\nMax_relay_log_sizeMax relay log size for this connection. Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS only.\nExecuted_log_entriesHow many log entries the replica has executed. Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS only.\nSlave_received_heartbeatsHow many heartbeats we have got from the master. Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS only.\nSlave_heartbeat_periodHow often to request a heartbeat packet from the master (in seconds). Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS only.\nGtid_Slave_PosGTID of the last event group replicated on a replica server, for each replication domain, as stored in the gtid_slave_pos system variable. Returned with SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS only.\nSQL_DelayValue specified by MASTER_DELAY in CHANGE MASTER (or 0 if none).\nSQL_Remaining_DelayWhen the replica is delaying the execution of an event due to MASTER_DELAY, this is the number of seconds of delay remaining before the event will be applied. Otherwise, the value is NULL.\nSlave_SQL_Running_StateThe state of the SQL driver threads, same as in SHOW PROCESSLIST. When the replica is delaying the execution of an event due to MASTER_DELAY, this field displays: \"Waiting until MASTER_DELAY seconds after master executed event\".\nSlave_DDL_GroupsThis status variable counts the occurrence of DDL statements.  This is a replica-side counter for optimistic parallel replication.\nSlave_Non_Transactional_GroupsThis status variable counts the occurrence of non-transactional event groups.  This is a replica-side counter for optimistic parallel replication.\nSlave_Transactional_GroupsThis status variable counts the occurrence of transactional event groups.  This is a replica-side counter for optimistic parallel replication.\nReplicate_Rewrite_DB\nRetried_transactions\nMax_relay_log_size\nExecuted_log_entries\nSlave_received_heartbeats\nSlave_heartbeat_period\nGtid_Slave_Pos\nMaster_last_event_timeTimestamp of the last event read from the primary by the IO thread. NULL until the replica has started and the replica has read one query event from the primary that changes data. From MariaDB 11.6.\nSlave_last_event_timePrimary timestamp of the last event committed on the replica. NULL until the replica has started and the replica has read one query event from the primary that changes data. From MariaDB 11.6.\nMaster_Slave_time_diffThe difference of the above two timestamps. NULL until the replica has started and the replica has read one query event from the primary that changes data. From MariaDB 11.6.\n\n"
