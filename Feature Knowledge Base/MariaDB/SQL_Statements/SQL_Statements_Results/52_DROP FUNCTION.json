    "Description": [
        "The DROP FUNCTION statement is used to drop a stored function or a user-defined function (UDF). That is, the specified routine is removed from the server, along with all privileges specific to the function. You must have the ALTER ROUTINE privilege for the routine in order to drop it. If the automatic_sp_privileges server system variable is set, both the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE privileges are granted automatically to the routine creator - see Stored Routine Privileges.",
        "IF EXISTS",
        "The IF EXISTS clause is a MySQL/MariaDB extension.  It\nprevents an error from occurring if the function does not exist. A\nNOTE is produced that can be viewed with SHOW WARNINGS.",
        "For dropping a user-defined functions (UDF), see DROP FUNCTION UDF."
