    "Description": [
        "The SHOW CLIENT_STATISTICS statement is part of the User Statistics feature. It was removed as a separate statement in MariaDB 10.1.1, but effectively replaced by the generic SHOW information_schema_table statement. The information_schema.CLIENT_STATISTICS table holds statistics about client connections.",
        "The userstat system variable must be set to 1 to activate this feature. See the User Statistics and information_schema.CLIENT_STATISTICS articles for more information."
