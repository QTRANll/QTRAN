        "This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a stored\nprocedure. More than one change may be specified in an ALTER PROCEDURE\nstatement. However, you cannot change the parameters or body of a\nstored procedure using this statement. To make such changes, you must\ndrop and re-create the procedure using either CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE (since MariaDB 10.1.3) or DROP PROCEDURE and CREATE PROCEDURE (MariaDB 10.1.2 and before).",
