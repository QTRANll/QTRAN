    "Description": [
        "START SLAVE (START REPLICA from MariaDB 10.5.1) with no thread_type options starts both of the replica threads (see replication) needed to connect with a master setup with  CHANGE MASTER TO .\n The I/O thread reads events from the primary server and stores\nthem in the relay log. The SQL thread reads events from the relay log\nand executes them. START SLAVE requires the SUPER privilege, or, from MariaDB 10.5.2, the REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN privilege.",
        "If START SLAVE succeeds in starting the replica threads, it returns\nwithout any error. However, even in that case, it might be that the\nreplica threads start and then later stop (for example, because they do\nnot manage to connect to the primary or read its binary log, or some\nother problem). START SLAVE does not warn you about this. You must\ncheck the replica's error log for error messages generated by the replica\nthreads, or check that they are running satisfactorily with SHOW SLAVE\nSTATUS (SHOW REPLICA STATUS from MariaDB 10.5.1).",
