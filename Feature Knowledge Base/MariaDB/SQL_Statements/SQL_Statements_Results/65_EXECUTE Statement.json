If the\nprepared statement contains any parameter markers, you must supply a\nUSING clause that lists user variables containing the values to be\nbound to the parameters. Parameter values can be supplied only by user\nvariables, and the USING clause must name exactly as many variables as\nthe number of parameter markers in the statement.",
        "You can execute a given prepared statement multiple times, passing\ndifferent variables to it or setting the variables to different values\nbefore each execution.",
