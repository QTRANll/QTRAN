        "This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a stored\nfunction. More than one change may be specified in an ALTER FUNCTION\nstatement. However, you cannot change the parameters or body of a\nstored function using this statement; to make such changes, you must\ndrop and re-create the function using DROP FUNCTION and CREATE FUNCTION.",
        "You must have the ALTER ROUTINE privilege for the function. (That\nprivilege is granted automatically to the function creator.) If binary\nlogging is enabled, the ALTER FUNCTION statement might also require\nthe SUPER privilege, as described in Binary Logging of Stored Routines."
