    "Description": [
        "The SET statement in stored programs is an extended version of the general SET statement. Referenced variables may be ones declared inside a stored program, global system variables, or user-defined variables.",
        "The SET statement in stored programs is implemented as part of the\npre-existing SET syntax. This allows an extended syntax of SET a=x, \nb=y, ... where different variable types (locally declared variables,\nglobal and session server variables, user-defined variables) can be\nmixed. This also allows combinations of local variables and some\noptions that make sense only for system variables; in that case, the\noptions are recognized but ignored.",
        "SET can be used with both local variables and user-defined variables.",
        "When setting several variables using the columns returned by a query, SELECT INTO should be preferred.",
        "To set many variables to the same value, the LAST_VALUE( ) function can be used.",
        "Below is an example of how a user-defined variable may be set:",
        "SET @x = 1;\n"
