    "Feature": [
        "SHOW TRIGGERS [FROM db_name]\n    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        " SHOW TRIGGERS lists the triggers currently defined for\ntables in a database (the default database unless a FROM\nclause is given).  This statement requires the\nTRIGGER privilege (prior to MySQL\n5.1.22, it required the SUPER privilege). ",
        "The LIKE clause, if present on its own, indicates which table names to\nmatch and causes the statement to display triggers for those tables. The WHERE and LIKE clauses can be given to select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in Extended SHOW.",
        "Similar information is stored in the information_schema.TRIGGERS table.",
        "If there are multiple triggers for the same action, then the triggers are shown in action order."
