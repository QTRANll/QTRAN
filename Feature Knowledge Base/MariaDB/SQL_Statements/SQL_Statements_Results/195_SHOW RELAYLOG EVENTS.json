    "Description": [
        "On replicas, this command shows the events in the relay log. If 'log_name' is not specified, the first relay log is shown.",
        "Syntax for the LIMIT clause is the same as for SELECT ... LIMIT.",
        "Using the LIMIT clause is highly recommended because the SHOW RELAYLOG EVENTS command returns the complete contents of the relay log, which can be quite large.\n",
        "This command does not return events related to setting user and system variables. If you need those, use mariadb-binlog.",
        "On the primary, this command does nothing.",
        "Requires the REPLICA MONITOR privilege (>= MariaDB 10.5.9), the REPLICATION SLAVE ADMIN privilege (>= MariaDB 10.5.2) or the REPLICATION SLAVE privilege (<= MariaDB 10.5.1).",
        "connection_name",
        "If there is only one nameless primary, or the default primary (as specified by the default_master_connection system variable) is intended, connection_name can be omitted. If provided, the SHOW RELAYLOG statement will apply to the specified primary. connection_name is case-insensitive.",
        "MariaDB starting with 10.7.0The FOR CHANNEL keyword was added for MySQL compatibility. This is identical as\nusing the channel_name directly after SHOW RELAYLOG.\n"
