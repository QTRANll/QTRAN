    "Description": [
        "This statement displays the CREATE EVENT statement that creates a given event, as well as the SQL_MODE that was used when the trigger has been created and the character set used by the connection. To find out which events are present, use SHOW EVENTS.",
        "SHOW CREATE EVENT quotes identifiers according to the value of the sql_quote_show_create system variable. Prior to MariaDB 10.6.5, MariaDB 10.5.13 and MariaDB 10.4.22, the output of this statement was unreliably affected by the sql_quote_show_create system variable.",
        "The information_schema.EVENTS table provides similar, but more complete, information."
