        "The CHECK VIEW statement was introduced in MariaDB 10.0.18 to assist with fixing MDEV-6916, an issue introduced in MariaDB 5.2 where the view algorithms were swapped. It checks whether the view algorithm is correct. It is run as part of mariadb-upgrade, and should not normally be required in regular use."
