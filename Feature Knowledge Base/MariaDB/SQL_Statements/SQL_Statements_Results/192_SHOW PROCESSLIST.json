    "Description": [
        "SHOW PROCESSLIST shows you which threads are running. You\ncan also get this information from the\ninformation_schema.PROCESSLIST table or the mariadb-admin processlist command. If you have the \nPROCESS privilege, you can see all threads.\nOtherwise, you can see only your own threads (that is, threads associated with\nthe MariaDB account that you are using). If you do not use the\nFULL keyword, only the first 100 characters of each\nstatement are shown in the Info field.",
        "The columns shown in SHOW PROCESSLIST are:",
        "NameDescription\nIDThe client's process ID.\nUSERThe username associated with the process.\nHOSTThe host the client is connected to.\nDBThe default database of the process (NULL if no default).\nCOMMANDThe command type. See Thread Command Values.\nTIMEThe amount of time, in seconds, the process has been in its current state. For a replica SQL thread before MariaDB 10.1, this is the time in seconds between the last replicated event's timestamp and the replica machine's real time.\nSTATESee Thread States.\nINFOThe statement being executed.\nTIME_MSQuery statement time.\nSTAGEStage of the statement execution.\nMAX_STAGELast stage of the statement executeion.\nPROGRESSThe total progress of the process (0-100%) (see Progress Reporting).\nMEMORY_USEDMemory used by the statement.\nMAX_MEMORY_USEDPeak value of the memory usage for this statement.\nEXAMINED_ROWSRows examined.\nSENT_ROWSRows sent to client.\nQUERY_IDID of the statement being executed.\nINFO_BINARYInfo in binary charset.\nTIDOS thread ID (when applicable).\nTMP_SPACE_USEDAmount of space used in tmp directory.\n\n",
        "The information_schema.PROCESSLIST  table contains a number of additional columns. See TIME_MS column in information_schema.PROCESSLIST for differences in the TIME column between MariaDB and MySQL.",
        "Note that the PROGRESS field from the information schema, and the PROGRESS field from SHOW PROCESSLIST display different results. SHOW PROCESSLIST shows the total progress, while the information schema shows the progress for the current stage only.",
        "Threads can be killed using their thread_id or their query_id, with the KILL statement.",
        "Since queries on this table are locking, if the performance_schema is enabled, you may want to query the THREADS table instead."
