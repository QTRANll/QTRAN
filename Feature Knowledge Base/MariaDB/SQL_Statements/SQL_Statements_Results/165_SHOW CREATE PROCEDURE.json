    "Description": [
        "This statement is a MariaDB extension. It returns the exact string that\ncan be used to re-create the named stored procedure, as well as the SQL_MODE that was used when the trigger has been created and the character set used by the connection.. A similar statement, SHOW CREATE FUNCTION, displays information about stored functions.",
        "Both statements require that:",
        "you are the owner of the routine;\nyou have the SHOW CREATE ROUTINE privilege (from MariaDB 11.3.0); or\nhave the SELECT privilege on the mysql.proc table.\n",
        "When none of the above statements are true, the statements display NULL for the Create Procedure or Create Function field.",
        "Warning Users with SELECT privileges on mysql.proc or USAGE privileges on *.* can view the text of routines, even when they do not have privileges for the function or procedure itself.\n",
        "SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE quotes identifiers according to the value of the sql_quote_show_create system variable. Prior to MariaDB 10.6.5, MariaDB 10.5.13 and MariaDB 10.4.22, the output of this statement was unreliably affected by the sql_quote_show_create system variable."
