        "The DROP PACKAGE BODY statement drops the package body (i.e the implementation), previously created using the CREATE PACKAGE BODY statement.",
        "Note, DROP PACKAGE BODY drops only the package implementation, but does not drop the package specification. Use DROP PACKAGE to drop the package entirely (i.e. both implementation and specification)."
