        "The RENAME USER statement renames existing MariaDB accounts. To use it,\nyou must have the global CREATE USER privilege\nor the UPDATE privilege for the mysql database.\nEach account is named using the same format as for the CREATE USER\nstatement; for example, 'jeffrey'@'localhost'.\nIf you specify only the user name part of the account name, a host\nname part of '%' is used.",
        "If any of the old user accounts do not exist or any of the new user accounts already\nexist, ERROR 1396 (HY000) results. If an error occurs, RENAME USER\nwill still rename the accounts that do not result in an error.",
