    "Description": [
        "The SHOW INDEX_STATISTICS statement was introduced in MariaDB 5.2 as part of the User Statistics feature. It was removed as a separate statement in MariaDB 10.1.1, but effectively replaced by the generic SHOW information_schema_table statement. The information_schema.INDEX_STATISTICS table shows statistics on index usage and makes it possible to do such things as locating unused indexes and generating the commands to remove them. ",
        "The userstat system variable must be set to 1 to activate this feature. See the User Statistics and information_schema.INDEX_STATISTICS table for more information."
