        "LOOP implements a simple loop construct, enabling repeated execution\nof the statement list, which consists of one or more statements, each\nterminated by a semicolon (i.e., ;) statement delimiter. The statements\nwithin the loop are repeated until the loop is exited; usually this is\naccomplished with a LEAVE statement.",
        "A LOOP statement can be labeled. end_label cannot be given unless\nbegin_label also is present. If both are present, they must be the\nsame.",
