    ],
    "Description": [
        " SHOW OPEN TABLES lists the non-TEMPORARY\ntables that are currently open in the table cache. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/table-cache.html.",
        "The FROM and LIKE clauses may be used.",
        "The FROM\nclause, if present, restricts the tables shown to those present in the\ndb_name database. ",
        "The LIKE clause, if\npresent on its own, indicates which table names to match. The WHERE and LIKE clauses can be given to select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in Extended SHOW.",
        "The following information is returned:",
        "ColumnDescription\nDatabaseDatabase name.\nNameTable name.\nIn_useNumber of  table instances being used.\nName_locked1 if the table is name-locked, e.g. if it is being dropped or renamed, otherwise 0.\n\n",
        "Before MariaDB 5.5, each use of, for example, LOCK TABLE ... WRITE would increment In_use for that table. With the implementation of the metadata locking improvements in MariaDB 5.5, LOCK TABLE... WRITE acquires a strong MDL lock, and concurrent connections will wait on this MDL lock, so any subsequent LOCK TABLE... WRITE will not increment In_use."
