        "PURGE { BINARY | MASTER } LOGS\n    { TO 'log_name' | BEFORE datetime_expr }\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "The PURGE BINARY LOGS statement deletes all the binary log\nfiles listed in the log index file prior to the specified log file name or\ndate. BINARY and MASTER are synonyms.\nDeleted log files also are removed from the list recorded in the index file, so\nthat the given log file becomes the first in the list.",
        "The datetime expression is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'. ",
        "If a replica is active but has yet to read from a binary log file you attempt to delete, the statement will fail with an error. However, if the replica is not connected and has yet to read from a log file you delete, the file will be deleted, but the replica will be unable to continue replicating once it connects again.\n",
        "This statement has no effect if the server was not started with the\n--log-bin option to enable binary logging.",
        "To list the binary log files on the server, use SHOW BINARY LOGS. To see which files they are reading, use SHOW SLAVE STATUS (or SHOW REPLICA STATUS from MariaDB 10.5.1). You can only delete the files that are older than the oldest file that is used by the slaves.",
        "To delete all binary log files, use RESET MASTER.\nTo move to a new log file (for example if you want to remove the current log file), use FLUSH LOGS before you execute PURGE LOGS.",
        "If the expire_logs_days server system variable is not set to 0, the server automatically deletes binary log files after the given number of days. From MariaDB 10.6, the binlog_expire_logs_seconds variable allows more precise control over binlog deletion, and takes precedence if both are non-zero.",
        "Requires the SUPER privilege or, from MariaDB 10.5.2, the BINLOG ADMIN privilege, to run."
