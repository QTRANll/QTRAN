    "Description": [
        "The CREATE INDEX statement is used to add indexes to a table. Indexes can be created at the same as the table, with the CREATE TABLE statement. In some cases, such as for InnoDB primary keys, doing so during creation is preferable, as adding a primary key will involve rebuilding the table.",
        "The statement is mapped to an ALTER TABLE statement to create indexes.\nSee ALTER TABLE. CREATE INDEX cannot be used to create a\nPRIMARY KEY; use ALTER TABLE instead.",
        "If another connection is using the table, a metadata lock is active, and this statement will wait until the lock is released. This is also true for non-transactional tables.",
        "Another shortcut, DROP INDEX, allows the removal of an index.",
        "For valid identifiers to use as index names, see Identifier Names.",
        "For limits on InnoDB indexes, see InnoDB Limitations.",
        "Note that KEY_BLOCK_SIZE is currently ignored in CREATE INDEX, although it is included in the output of SHOW CREATE TABLE.\n"
