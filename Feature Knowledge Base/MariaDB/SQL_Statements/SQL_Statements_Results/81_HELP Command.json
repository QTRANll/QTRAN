    "Description": [
        "The HELP command can be used in any MariaDB client, such as the mariadb command-line client, to get basic syntax help and a short description for most commands and functions. ",
        "If you provide an argument to the HELP command, the mariadb client uses it as a search string to access server-side help. The proper operation of this command requires that the help tables in the mysql database be initialized with help topic information.",
        "If there is no match for the search string, the search fails. Use HELP contents to see a list of the help categories:",
        "HELP contents\nYou asked for help about help category: \"Contents\"\nFor more information, type 'help <item>', where <item> is one of the following\ncategories:\n   Account Management\n   Administration\n   Compound Statements\n   Data Definition\n   Data Manipulation\n   Data Types\n   Functions\n   Functions and Modifiers for Use with GROUP BY\n   Geographic Features\n   Help Metadata\n   Language Structure\n   Plugins\n   Procedures\n   Sequences\n   Table Maintenance\n   Transactions\n   User-Defined Functions\n   Utility\n",
        "If a search string matches multiple items, MariaDB shows a list of matching topics:",
        "HELP drop\nMany help items for your request exist.\nTo make a more specific request, please type 'help <item>',\nwhere <item> is one of the following\ntopics:\n   ALTER TABLE\n   DROP DATABASE\n   DROP EVENT\n   DROP FUNCTION\n   DROP FUNCTION UDF\n   DROP INDEX\n   DROP PACKAGE\n   DROP PACKAGE BODY\n   DROP PROCEDURE\n   DROP ROLE\n   DROP SEQUENCE\n   DROP SERVER\n   DROP TABLE\n   DROP TRIGGER\n   DROP USER\n   DROP VIEW\n",
        "Then you can enter a topic as the search string to see the help entry for that topic.",
        "The help is provided with the MariaDB server and makes use of four help tables found in the mysql database: help_relation, help_topic, help_category and help_keyword. These tables are populated by the mariadb-install-db or fill_help_table.sql scripts."
