        "SET PASSWORD [FOR user] =\n    {\n        PASSWORD('some password')\n      | OLD_PASSWORD('some password')\n      | 'encrypted password'\n    }\n"

    "Description": [
        "The SET PASSWORD statement assigns a password to an existing MariaDB user\naccount.",
        "If the password is specified using the PASSWORD() or OLD_PASSWORD()\nfunction, the literal text of the password should be given. If the\npassword is specified without using either function, the password\nshould be the already-encrypted password value as returned by\nPASSWORD().",
        "OLD_PASSWORD() should only be used if your MariaDB/MySQL clients are very old (< 4.0.0).",
        "With no FOR clause, this statement sets the password for the current\nuser. Any client that has connected to the server using a non-anonymous\naccount can change the password for that account.",
        "With a FOR clause, this statement sets the password for a specific\naccount on the current server host. Only clients that have the UPDATE\nprivilege for the mysql database can do this. The user value should be\ngiven in user_name@host_name format, where user_name and host_name are\nexactly as they are listed in the User and Host columns of the\nmysql.user table (or view in MariaDB-10.4 onwards) entry. ",
        "The argument to PASSWORD() and the password given to MariaDB clients can be of arbitrary length."
