    "Feature": [
        "DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS] [/*COMMENT TO SAVE*/]\n    tbl_name [, tbl_name] ...\n    [WAIT n|NOWAIT]\n    [RESTRICT | CASCADE]\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "DROP TABLE removes one or more tables. You must have the DROP privilege\nfor each table. All table data and the table definition are removed, as well as triggers associated to the table, so be\ncareful with this statement! If any of the tables named in the argument list do\nnot exist, MariaDB returns an error indicating by name which non-existing tables\nit was unable to drop, but it also drops all of the tables in the list that do\nexist.",
        "Important: When a table is dropped, user privileges on the table are not\nautomatically dropped. See GRANT.",
        "If another thread is using the table in an explicit transaction or an autocommit transaction, then the thread acquires a metadata lock (MDL) on the table. The DROP TABLE statement will wait in the \"Waiting for table metadata lock\" thread state until the MDL is released. MDLs are released in the following cases:",
        "If an MDL is acquired in an explicit transaction, then the MDL will be released when the transaction ends.\nIf an MDL is acquired in an autocommit transaction, then the MDL will be released when the statement ends.\nTransactional and non-transactional tables are handled the same.\n",
        "Note that for a partitioned table, DROP TABLE permanently removes the table\ndefinition, all of its partitions, and all of the data which was stored in\nthose partitions. It also removes the partitioning definition (.par) file\nassociated with the dropped table.",
        "For each referenced table, DROP TABLE drops a temporary table with that name, if it exists. If it does not exist, and the TEMPORARY keyword is not used, it drops a non-temporary table with the same name, if it exists. The TEMPORARY keyword ensures that a non-temporary table will not accidentally be dropped.",
        "Use IF EXISTS to prevent an error from occurring for tables that do not\nexist. A NOTE is generated for each non-existent table when using\nIF EXISTS. See SHOW WARNINGS.",
        "If a foreign key references this table, the table cannot be dropped. In this case, it is necessary to drop the foreign key first.",
        "RESTRICT and CASCADE are allowed to make porting from other database systems easier. In MariaDB, they do nothing.",
        "The comment before the table names (/*COMMENT TO SAVE*/) is stored in the binary log. That feature can be used by replication tools to send their internal messages.",
        "It is possible to specify table names as db_name.tab_name. This is useful to delete tables from multiple databases with one statement. See Identifier Qualifiers for details.",
        "The DROP privilege is required to use DROP TABLE on non-temporary tables. For temporary tables, no privilege is required, because such tables are only visible for the current session.",
        "Note: DROP TABLE automatically commits the current active transaction,\nunless you use the TEMPORARY keyword.",
        "MariaDB starting with 10.5.4From MariaDB 10.5.4, DROP TABLE reliably deletes table remnants inside a storage engine even if the .frm file is missing. Before then, a missing .frm file would result in the statement failing.\n",
        "WAIT/NOWAIT",
        "Set the lock wait timeout. See WAIT and NOWAIT."
