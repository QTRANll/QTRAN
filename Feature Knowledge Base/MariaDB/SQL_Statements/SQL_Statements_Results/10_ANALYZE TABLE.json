    "Feature": [
        "ANALYZE [NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG | LOCAL] TABLE tbl_name [,tbl_name ...]\n  [PERSISTENT FOR \n    { ALL\n      | COLUMNS ([col_name [,col_name ...]]) INDEXES ([index_name [,index_name ...]])\n    }\n  ]         \n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "ANALYZE TABLE analyzes and stores the key distribution for a\ntable (index statistics). This statement works with MyISAM, Aria and InnoDB tables. During the analysis, InnoDB will allow reads/writes, and MyISAM/Aria reads/inserts. For MyISAM tables, this statement is equivalent to using myisamchk --analyze.",
        "For more information on how the analysis works within InnoDB, see\nInnoDB Limitations.",
        "MariaDB uses the stored key distribution to decide the order in which\ntables should be joined when you perform a join on something other than\na constant. In addition, key distributions can be used when deciding\nwhich indexes to use for a specific table within a query.",
        "This statement requires SELECT and INSERT privileges for the table.",
        "By default, ANALYZE TABLE statements are written to the binary log and will be replicated. The NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword (LOCAL is an alias) will ensure the statement is not written to the binary log. ",
        "From MariaDB 10.3.19, ANALYZE TABLE statements are not logged to the binary log if read_only is set. See also Read-Only Replicas.",
        "ANALYZE TABLE is also supported for partitioned tables. You\ncan use ALTER TABLE ... ANALYZE PARTITION to analyze one or\nmore partitions.",
        "The Aria storage engine supports progress reporting for the ANALYZE TABLE statement."
