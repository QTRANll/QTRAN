    "Description": [
        "The OFFSET clause allows one to return only those elements of a resultset that come after a specified offset. The FETCH clause specifies the number of rows to return, while ONLY or WITH TIES specifies whether or not to also return any further results that tie for last place according to the ordered resultset.",
        "Either the singular ROW or the plural ROWS can be used after the OFFSET and FETCH clauses; the choice has no impact on the results. ",
        "FIRST and NEXT gives the same result.",
        "In the case of WITH TIES, an ORDER BY clause is required, otherwise an ERROR will be returned.",
        "SELECT i FROM t1 FETCH FIRST 2 ROWS WITH TIES;\nERROR 4180 (HY000): FETCH ... WITH TIES requires ORDER BY clause to be present\n"
