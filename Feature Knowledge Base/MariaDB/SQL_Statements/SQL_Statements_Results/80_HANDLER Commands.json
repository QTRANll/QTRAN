    "Description": [
        "The HANDLER statement provides direct access to table\nstorage engine interfaces for key lookups and key or table scans. It is available for at least Aria, Memory, MyISAM and InnoDB tables (and should work with most 'normal' storage engines, but not with system tables, MERGE or views).",
        "HANDLER ... OPEN opens a table, allowing it to be accessible to subsequent HANDLER ... READ statements. The table can either be opened using an alias, or a table name. If opened with an alias, references to this table by further HANDLER statements must use this alias, and not the table name. If opened with a table name qualified by database name, further references to this table must use the unqualified table name. For example, if a table is opened with db1.t1, further references must use t1. ",
        "The table object is only closed when HANDLER ... CLOSE is called by the session, or the session closes, and is not shared by other sessions.",
        "Prepared statements work with HANDLER READ, which gives a much higher performance (50% speedup) as there is no parsing and all data is transformed in binary (without conversions to text, as with the normal protocol).",
        "The HANDLER command does not work with partitioned tables."
