        "ALTER SEQUENCE will instantly affect all future SEQUENCE operations.  This is in contrast to some other databases where the changes requested by ALTER SEQUENCE will not be seen until the sequence cache has run out.",
        "ALTER SEQUENCE will take a full table lock of the sequence object during\nits (brief) operation. This ensures that ALTER SEQUENCE is replicated\ncorrectly.  If you only want to set the next sequence value to a\nhigher value than current, then you should use SETVAL()\ninstead, as this is not blocking.",
        "If you want to change storage engine, sequence comment or rename the sequence, you can use ALTER TABLE for this."
