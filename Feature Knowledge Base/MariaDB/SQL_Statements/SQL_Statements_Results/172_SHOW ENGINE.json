        "The statement displays the following output fields:",
        "Type: Always InnoDB.\nName: The source file where the mutex is implemented, and the line number\n  in the file where the mutex is created. The line number is dependent on the MariaDB version.\nStatus: This field displays the following values if UNIV_DEBUG was defined at compilation time (for example, in include/univ.h in the InnoDB part of the source tree). Only the os_waits value is displayed if UNIV_DEBUG was not defined. Without UNIV_DEBUG, the information on which the output is based is insufficient to distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes that protect\n  rw-locks (which allow multiple readers or a single writer). Consequently, the\n  output may appear to contain multiple rows for the same mutex.\ncount indicates how many times the mutex was requested.\nspin_waits indicates how many times the spinlock had to run.\nspin_rounds indicates the number of spinlock rounds. (spin_rounds divided by\n   spin_waits provides the average round count.)\nos_waits indicates the number of operating system waits. This occurs when\n   the spinlock did not work (the mutex was not locked during the spinlock and\n   it was necessary to yield to the operating system and wait).\nos_yields indicates the number of times a the thread trying to lock a mutex\n   gave up its timeslice and yielded to the operating system (on the\n   presumption that allowing other threads to run will free the mutex so that\n   it can be locked).\nos_wait_times indicates the amount of time (in ms) spent in operating system\n   waits, if the timed_mutexes system variable is 1 (ON). If timed_mutexes is 0\n   (OFF), timing is disabled, so os_wait_times is 0. timed_mutexes is off by\n   default.\n\n",
