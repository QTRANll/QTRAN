    "Description": [
        "In an INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statement, you can use the VALUES(col_name) function in the  UPDATE clause to refer to column values from the  INSERT portion of the statement. In other words,  VALUES(col_name) in the UPDATE clause refers to the value of col_name that would be inserted, had no duplicate-key conflict occurred. This function is especially useful in multiple-row inserts.",
        "The VALUES() function is meaningful only in INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements and returns NULL otherwise.",
        "In MariaDB 10.3.3 this function was renamed to VALUE(), because it's incompatible with the standard Table Value Constructors syntax, implemented in MariaDB 10.3.3.",
        "The VALUES() function can still be used even from MariaDB 10.3.3, but only in INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements; it's a syntax error otherwise."
