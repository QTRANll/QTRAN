        "Returns a representation of the unix_timestamp argument as a value in\n'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.uuuuuu format, depending on\nwhether the function is used in a string or numeric context. The value\nis expressed in the current time zone. unix_timestamp is an internal\ntimestamp value such as is produced by the UNIX_TIMESTAMP() function.",

Using the function on a timestamp beyond this will result in NULL being returned. Use DATETIME as a storage type if you require dates beyond this.\n",
