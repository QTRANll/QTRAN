    "Description": [
        "Returns 1 if g1 spatially crosses g2. Returns NULL if g1 is\na Polygon or a MultiPolygon, or if g2 is a\nPoint or a MultiPoint. Otherwise, returns 0.",
        "The term spatially crosses denotes a spatial relation between two\ngiven geometries that has the following properties:",
        "The two geometries intersect\nTheir intersection results in a geometry that has a dimension that is one\n  less than the maximum dimension of the two given geometries\nTheir intersection is not equal to either of the two given geometries\n",
        "CROSSES() is based on the original MySQL implementation, and uses object bounding rectangles, while ST_CROSSES() uses object shapes."
