## Set Up
error_iteration=True，sqls_type="simple"，FewShot=True ，length_range = [1,240)
temperature = 0

## Conclusion
origin sql和mutate sql分别各自transfer后，等价关系被打破的原因主要有：
1. 变异行为被遗漏：如mutate sql的DISTINCT被丢失，详见样例0，7，17等等
2. transfer时的不确定性强
* 当db A到db B 没有直接对应的相似功能函数时，各自单独进行transfer的随机性很强（即使temperature已经设置为0），详见样例0等等
* 当db A到db B 有直接对应的相似功能函数时，各自单独进行transfer也存在随机性（即使temperature已经设置为0），详见样例2，6，9，（25和26对比样例）等等
3. 缺乏相关知识
* 当db A到db B 有直接对应的相似功能函数时，但是由于缺乏相关的知识，进行transfer时没有替换正确，详见样例3，7等等

transfer_origin_sqlsim:SELECT (NULLIF(COALESCE('d', NULL), NULL) IS NULL) AS f1, (f4) AS f2, (f4) AS f3 FROM (SELECT col_bigint_key_unsigned AS f4, col_bigint_key_signed AS f5, col_float_key_signed AS f6 FROM table_3_utf8_undef) AS t1
transfer_mutated_sqlsim:SELECT (NULLIF('d', '')) AS f1, (f4) AS f2, (f4) AS f3 FROM (SELECT col_bigint_key_unsigned AS f4, col_bigint_key_signed AS f5, col_float_key_signed AS f6 FROM table_3_utf8_undef) AS t1

在 PostgreSQL 中，没有直接对应于 MariaDB 的 COERCIBILITY 函数的内置函数。transfer后的等价性无法保证。
DISTINCT也丢失了。

origin_sqlsim:SELECT (`f6`) AS `f1`,(SEC_TO_TIME(6893404095556107954)) AS `f2`,(~LEFT(1, 9)) AS `f3` FROM (SELECT `col_varchar(20)_undef_signed` AS `f4`,`col_float_key_signed` AS `f5`,`col_float_key_unsigned` AS `f6` FROM `table_7_utf8_undef`) AS `t1`
mutated_sqlsim:SELECT DISTINCT (`f6`) AS `f1`,(SEC_TO_TIME(6893404095556107954)) AS `f2`,(~LEFT(1, 9)) AS `f3` FROM (SELECT `col_varchar(20)_undef_signed` AS `f4`,`col_float_key_signed` AS `f5`,`col_float_key_unsigned` AS `f6` FROM `table_7_utf8_undef`) AS `t1`
transfer_origin_sqlsim:SELECT (f6) AS f1, (TO_TIMESTAMP(6893404095556107954 / 1000000000)) AS f2, (~(CAST(LEFT('1', 9) AS INTEGER))) AS f3 FROM (SELECT col_varchar_20_undef_signed AS f4, col_float_key_signed AS f5, col_float_key_unsigned AS f6 FROM table_7_utf8_undef) AS t1
transfer_mutated_sqlsim:SELECT DISTINCT (f6) AS f1, (TO_TIMESTAMP(NULL)) AS f2, (~(LEFT('1', 9)::INTEGER)) AS f3 FROM (SELECT col_varchar_20_undef_signed AS f4, col_float_key_signed AS f5, col_float_key_unsigned AS f6 FROM table_7_utf8_undef) AS t1

在 PostgreSQL 中，没有直接对应于 MariaDB 的 SEC_TO_TIME 函数的内置函数，可以用其他方法实现相同的功能。通常可以通过将秒数转换为时间格式来达到类似的效果。transfer_origin_sqlsim成功进行了转换，而transfer_mutated_sqlsim则没有。

COLLATION的transfer错误。在 PostgreSQL 中，字符集的比较和排序也可以通过 COLLATE 关键字来实现，llm缺乏关于COLLATE 的知识。

mutated_sqlsim:SELECT DISTINCT ('come'^LCASE(1)) AS `f1`,(~CHARSET(1)) AS `f2`,(`f5`) AS `f3` FROM (SELECT `col_bigint_undef_signed` AS `f4`,`col_float_key_signed` AS `f5`,`col_double_undef_signed` AS `f6` FROM `table_3_utf8_undef`) AS `t1`
transfer_origin_sqlsim:SELECT (('come' || LOWER('1'))) AS f1, (~CHAR_LENGTH('1')) AS f2, (f5) AS f3 FROM (SELECT col_bigint_undef_signed AS f4, col_float_key_signed AS f5, col_double_undef_signed AS f6 FROM table_3_utf8_undef) AS t1
transfer_mutated_sqlsim:SELECT DISTINCT (LOWER('come')) AS f1, (1) AS f2, (f5) AS f3 FROM (SELECT col_bigint_undef_signed AS f4, col_float_key_signed AS f5, col_double_undef_signed AS f6 FROM table_3_utf8_undef) AS t1

LCASE transfer 为 LOWER是正确的，但transfer_mutated_sqlsim则遗漏了'come' ，导致不符合transfer的等价性。


### 7

丢失DISTINCT。
由于缺乏背景知识，CHARSET的transfer失败。MariaDB 使用 CHARSET 函数来获取字符串的字符集。PostgreSQL 通过 pg_client_encoding() 或 current_setting('server_encoding') 来实现类似功能。
不稳定性：(COS(-8146949091270667529) * -1) 和  (-COS(-8146949091270667529)) 则略有不同，但含义相同

COLLATION的transfer错误。在 PostgreSQL 中，字符集的比较和排序也可以通过 COLLATE 关键字来实现，llm缺乏关于COLLATE 的知识。

Postgtres中，与mariadb的MONTHNAME功能类似的函数包括多种，transfer_origin_sqlsim和transfer_mutated_sqlsim各自采用了不同的函数进行transfer。（EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DATE '2011-04-18'))的结果是Decimal('4')，(TO_CHAR(DATE '2011-04-18', 'Month'))的结果是April

关于`COERCIBILITY`，这里被transfer为COALESCE，两者功能是不相关的。在MariaDB中，`COERCIBILITY`函数用于返回某列或表达式的强制转换等级，它指示了该值在类型转换时的行为。PostgreSQL中没有直接对应的函数，可以使用`pg_type`系统表查看类型信息，或者使用`::`运算符进行显式类型转换来理解类型的相容性。

在MariaDB中，`DATE_ADD`函数用于向日期或时间值添加指定的时间间隔。
在PostgreSQL中，可以使用`+`运算符或`INTERVAL`关键字来实现类似的功能。
llm在transfer时，mariadb对固定值时间进行了加减操作，而transfer为postgre后则是对当前时间进行加减操作，这并不等价。应该转换为类似（'2024-01-01'::date + INTERVAL '1 day' * 24）的。

在MariaDB中，`DATE_ADD`函数用于向日期或时间值添加指定的时间间隔。`DATE_ADD(1, INTERVAL 1 QUARTER)`的含义是：这里的`1`通常被视为一个日期值（在这种情况下可能是`1970-01-01`，因为数字在日期上下文中会被转换为对应的日期）。`INTERVAL 1 QUARTER`：表示要增加的时间间隔是1个季度（3个月）。

在PostgreSQL中，可以使用`+`运算符或`INTERVAL`关键字来实现类似的功能。
llm在transfer时，用`DATE_TRUNC`函数将日期或时间值截断到指定的精度，返回一个新的日期或时间值，去掉比指定精度更小的部分。
transfer_origin_sqlsim将DATE_ADD  transfer为(DATE_TRUNC('quarter', '1970-01-01'::date) + INTERVAL '3 months')，含义和mariadb中基本等价。
transfer_mutated_sqlsim将DATE_ADD  transfer为(DATE_TRUNC('quarter', NOW()) + INTERVAL '3 MONTH')，则含义不同。
