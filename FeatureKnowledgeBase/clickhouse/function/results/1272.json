    "Description": [
        "hdfsCluster Table Function",
        "Allows processing files from HDFS in parallel from many nodes in a specified cluster. On initiator it creates a connection to all nodes in the cluster, discloses asterisks in HDFS file path, and dispatches each file dynamically. On the worker node it asks the initiator about the next task to process and processes it. This is repeated until all tasks are finished.",
        "Syntax",
        "hdfsCluster(cluster_name, URI, format, structure)",
        "Arguments",
        "cluster_name \u2014 Name of a cluster that is used to build a set of addresses and connection parameters to remote and local servers.URI \u2014 URI to a file or a bunch of files. Supports following wildcards in readonly mode: *, **, ?, {'abc','def'} and {N..M} where N, M \u2014 numbers, abc, def \u2014 strings. For more information see Wildcards In Path.format \u2014 The format of the file.structure \u2014 Structure of the table. Format 'column1_name column1_type, column2_name column2_type, ...'.",
