        "roundBankers",
        "Rounds a number to a specified decimal position.",
        "If the rounding number is halfway between two numbers, the function uses banker\u2019s rounding.\nBanker's rounding is a method of rounding fractional numbers\nWhen the rounding number is halfway between two numbers, it's rounded to the nearest even digit at the specified decimal position.\nFor example: 3.5 rounds up to 4, 2.5 rounds down to 2.\nIt's the default rounding method for floating point numbers defined in IEEE 754.\nThe round function performs the same rounding for floating point numbers.\nThe roundBankers function also rounds integers the same way, for example, roundBankers(45, -1) = 40.",
        "In other cases, the function rounds numbers to the nearest integer.",
        "Using banker\u2019s rounding, you can reduce the effect that rounding numbers has on the results of summing or subtracting these numbers.",
        "For example, sum numbers 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 with different rounding:",
        "No rounding: 1.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 4.5 = 12.Banker\u2019s rounding: 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 12.Rounding to the nearest integer: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.",

        "- `N > 0` \u2014 The function rounds the number to the given position right of the decimal point. Example: `roundBankers(3.55, 1) = 3.6`.- `N < 0` \u2014 The function rounds the number to the given position left of the decimal point. Example: `roundBankers(24.55, -1) = 20`.- `N = 0` \u2014 The function rounds the number to an integer. In this case the argument can be omitted. Example: `roundBankers(2.5) = 2`.",

Defaults to 0.If N > 0, the function rounds to the right of the decimal point.If N < 0, the function rounds to the left of the decimal point.If N = 0, the function rounds to the next integer.",
