        "Patterns in curly brackets { } are used to generate a set of shards and to specify replicas. If there are multiple pairs of curly brackets, then the direct product of the corresponding sets is generated.",
        "The following pattern types are supported.",
        "{a,b,c} - Represents any of alternative strings a, b or c. The pattern is replaced with a in the first shard address and replaced with b in the second shard address and so on. For instance, example0{1,2}-1 generates addresses example01-1 and example02-1.{N..M} - A range of numbers. This pattern generates shard addresses with incrementing indices from N to (and including) M. For instance, example0{1..2}-1 generates example01-1 and example02-1.{0n..0m} - A range of numbers with leading zeroes. This pattern preserves leading zeroes in indices. For instance, example{01..03}-1 generates example01-1, example02-1 and example03-1.{a|b} - Any number of variants separated by a |. The pattern specifies replicas. For instance, example01-{1|2} generates replicas example01-1 and example01-2.",
        "The query will be sent to the first healthy replica. However, for remote the replicas are iterated in the order currently set in the load_balancing setting.\nThe number of generated addresses is limited by table_function_remote_max_addresses setting."
