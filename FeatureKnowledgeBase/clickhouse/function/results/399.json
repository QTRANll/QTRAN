        "S2 is a geographical indexing system where all geographical data is represented on a three-dimensional sphere (similar to a globe).",
        "In the S2 library points are represented as the S2 Index - a specific number which encodes internally a point on the surface of a unit sphere, unlike traditional (latitude, longitude) pairs. To get the S2 point index for a given point specified in the format (latitude, longitude) use the geoToS2 function. Also, you can use the s2ToGeo function for getting geographical coordinates corresponding to the specified S2 point index."
