    ],
    "Description": [
        "approx_top_sum",
        "Returns an array of the approximately most frequent values and their counts in the specified column. The resulting array is sorted in descending order of approximate frequency of values (not by the values themselves). Additionally, the weight of the value is taken into account.",
        "approx_top_sum(N)(column, weight)approx_top_sum(N, reserved)(column, weight)",
        "This function does not provide a guaranteed result. In certain situations, errors might occur and it might return frequent values that aren\u2019t the most frequent values.",
        "We recommend using the N < 10 value; performance is reduced with large N values. Maximum value of N = 65536.",
        "Parameters",
        "N \u2014 The number of elements to return. Optional. Default value: 10.reserved \u2014 Defines, how many cells reserved for values. If uniq(column) > reserved, result of topK function will be approximate. Optional. Default value: N * 3.",
        "Arguments",
        "column \u2014 The value to calculate frequency.weight \u2014 The weight. Every value is accounted weight times for frequency calculation. UInt64."
