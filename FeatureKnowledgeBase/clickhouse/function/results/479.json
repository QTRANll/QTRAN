    "Description": [
        "wordShingleMinHashUTF8",
        "Splits a UTF-8 string into parts (shingles) of shinglesize words and calculates hash values for each word shingle. Uses hashnum minimum hashes to calculate the minimum hash and hashnum maximum hashes to calculate the maximum hash. Returns a tuple with these hashes. Is case sensitive.",
        "Can be used for detection of semi-duplicate strings with tupleHammingDistance. For two strings: if one of the returned hashes is the same for both strings, we think that those strings are the same.",
