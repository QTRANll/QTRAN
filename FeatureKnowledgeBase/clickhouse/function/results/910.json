        "tuple",
        "A function that allows grouping multiple columns.\nFor columns C1, C2, ... with the types T1, T2, ..., it returns a named Tuple(C1 T1, C2 T2, ...) type tuple containing these columns if their names are unique and can be treated as unquoted identifiers, otherwise a Tuple(T1, T2, ...) is returned. There is no cost to execute the function.\nTuples are normally used as intermediate values for an argument of IN operators, or for creating a list of formal parameters of lambda functions. Tuples can\u2019t be written to a table.",
