    ],
    "Description": [
        "sequenceCount",
        "Counts the number of event chains that matched the pattern. The function searches event chains that do not overlap. It starts to search for the next chain after the current chain is matched.",
        "NoteEvents that occur at the same second may lay in the sequence in an undefined order affecting the result.",
        "Syntax",
        "sequenceCount(pattern)(timestamp, cond1, cond2, ...)",
        "Arguments",
        "timestamp \u2014 Column considered to contain time data. Typical data types are Date and DateTime. You can also use any of the supported UInt data types.cond1, cond2 \u2014 Conditions that describe the chain of events. Data type: UInt8. You can pass up to 32 condition arguments. The function takes only the events described in these conditions into account. If the sequence contains data that isn\u2019t described in a condition, the function skips them.",
        "Parameters",
        "pattern \u2014 Pattern string. See Pattern syntax.",
        "Returned values",
        "Number of non-overlapping event chains that are matched.",
        "Type: UInt64."
