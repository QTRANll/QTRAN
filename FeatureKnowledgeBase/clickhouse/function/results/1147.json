    "Description": [
        "cramersVBiasCorrected",
        "Cramer's V is a measure of association between two columns in a table. The result of the cramersV function ranges from 0 (corresponding to no association between the variables) to 1 and can reach 1 only when each value is completely determined by the other. The function can be heavily biased, so this version of Cramer's V uses the bias correction.",

        "Returned value",
