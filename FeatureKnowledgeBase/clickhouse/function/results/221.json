    ],
    "Description": [
        "date_diff",
        "Returns the count of the specified unit boundaries crossed between the startdate and the enddate.\nThe difference is calculated using relative units, e.g. the difference between 2021-12-29 and 2022-01-01 is 3 days for unit day (see toRelativeDayNum), 1 month for unit month (see toRelativeMonthNum) and 1 year for unit year (see toRelativeYearNum).",
        "If unit week was specified, date_diff assumes that weeks start on Monday. Note that this behavior is different from that of function toWeek() in which weeks start by default on Sunday.",
        "For an alternative to date_diff, see function age.",
