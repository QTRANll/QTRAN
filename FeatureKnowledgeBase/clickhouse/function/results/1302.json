        "For non-public buckets, users can pass an aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key to the function. For example: ",

        "This is appropriate for one-off accesses or in cases where credentials can easily be rotated. However, this is not recommended as a long-term solution for repeated access or where credentials are sensitive. In this case, we recommend users rely on role-based access.",
        "Role-based access for S3 in ClickHouse Cloud is documented here.",
        "Once configured, a roleARN can be passed to the s3 function via an extra_credentials parameter. For example:",
