        "Applies the Mann-Whitney rank test to samples from two populations.",

        "Values of both samples are in the sample_data column. If sample_index equals to 0 then the value in that row belongs to the sample from the first population. Otherwise it belongs to the sample from the second population.\nThe null hypothesis is that two populations are stochastically equal. Also one-sided hypothesises can be tested. This test does not assume that data have normal distribution.",
