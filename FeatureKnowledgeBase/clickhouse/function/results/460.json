        "ngramSimHash",
        "Splits a ASCII string into n-grams of ngramsize symbols and returns the n-gram simhash. Is case sensitive.",
        "Can be used for detection of semi-duplicate strings with bitHammingDistance. The smaller is the Hamming Distance of the calculated simhashes of two strings, the more likely these strings are the same.",
