        "As table functions remote and remoteSecure re-establish the connection for each request, it is recommended to use a Distributed table instead. Also, if hostnames are set, the names are resolved, and errors are not counted when working with various replicas. When processing a large number of queries, always create the Distributed table ahead of time, and do not use the remote table function.",
        "The remote table function can be useful in the following cases:",
