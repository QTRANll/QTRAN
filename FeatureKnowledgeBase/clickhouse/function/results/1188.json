    "Description": [
        "quantileExact",
        "Exactly computes the quantile of a numeric data sequence.",
        "To get exact value, all the passed values are combined into an array, which is then partially sorted. Therefore, the function consumes O(n) memory, where n is a number of values that were passed. However, for a small number of values, the function is very effective.",
        "When using multiple quantile* functions with different levels in a query, the internal states are not combined (that is, the query works less efficiently than it could). In this case, use the quantiles function.",

        "Alias: medianExact.",
        "Arguments",
        "level \u2014 Level of quantile. Optional parameter. Constant floating-point number from 0 to 1. We recommend using a level value in the range of [0.01, 0.99]. Default value: 0.5. At level=0.5 the function calculates median.expr \u2014 Expression over the column values resulting in numeric data types, Date or DateTime.",
        "Returned value",
