    "Description": [
        "toString",
        "Functions for converting between numbers, strings (but not fixed strings), dates, and dates with times.\nAll these functions accept one argument.",
        "When converting to or from a string, the value is formatted or parsed using the same rules as for the TabSeparated format (and almost all other text formats). If the string can\u2019t be parsed, an exception is thrown and the request is canceled.",
        "When converting dates to numbers or vice versa, the date corresponds to the number of days since the beginning of the Unix epoch.\nWhen converting dates with times to numbers or vice versa, the date with time corresponds to the number of seconds since the beginning of the Unix epoch.",
        "The date and date-with-time formats for the toDate/toDateTime functions are defined as follows:",
        "YYYY-MM-DDYYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss",
        "As an exception, if converting from UInt32, Int32, UInt64, or Int64 numeric types to Date, and if the number is greater than or equal to 65536, the number is interpreted as a Unix timestamp (and not as the number of days) and is rounded to the date. This allows support for the common occurrence of writing toDate(unix_timestamp), which otherwise would be an error and would require writing the more cumbersome toDate(toDateTime(unix_timestamp)).",
        "Conversion between a date and a date with time is performed the natural way: by adding a null time or dropping the time.",
        "Conversion between numeric types uses the same rules as assignments between different numeric types in C++.",
        "Additionally, the toString function of the DateTime argument can take a second String argument containing the name of the time zone. Example: Asia/Yekaterinburg In this case, the time is formatted according to the specified time zone."
