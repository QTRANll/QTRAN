        "like",
        "Returns whether string haystack matches the LIKE expression pattern.",
        "A LIKE expression can contain normal characters and the following metasymbols:",
        "% indicates an arbitrary number of arbitrary characters (including zero characters)._ indicates a single arbitrary character.\\ is for escaping literals %, _ and \\.",
        "Matching is based on UTF-8, e.g. _ matches the Unicode code point \u00a5 which is represented in UTF-8 using two bytes.",
        "If the haystack or the LIKE expression are not valid UTF-8, the behavior is undefined.",
        "No automatic Unicode normalization is performed, you can use the normalizeUTF8*() functions for that.",
        "To match against literal %, _ and \\ (which are LIKE metacharacters), prepend them with a backslash: \\%, \\_ and \\\\.\nThe backslash loses its special meaning (i.e. is interpreted literally) if it prepends a character different than %, _ or \\.\nNote that ClickHouse requires backslashes in strings to be quoted as well, so you would actually need to write \\\\%, \\\\_ and \\\\\\\\.",
        "For LIKE expressions of the form %needle%, the function is as fast as the position function.\nAll other LIKE expressions are internally converted to a regular expression and executed with a performance similar to function match.",
