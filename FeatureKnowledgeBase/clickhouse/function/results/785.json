    "Description": [
        "ngramDistance",
        "Calculates the 4-gram distance between a haystack string and a needle string. For this, it counts the symmetric difference between two multisets of 4-grams and normalizes it by the sum of their cardinalities. Returns a Float32 between 0 and 1. The smaller the result is, the more similar the strings are to each other.",
        "Functions ngramDistanceCaseInsensitive, ngramDistanceUTF8, ngramDistanceCaseInsensitiveUTF8 provide case-insensitive and/or UTF-8 variants of this function.",

        "Parameters",
        "haystack: First comparison string. String literalneedle: Second comparison string. String literal",
        "Returned value",
        "Value between 0 and 1 representing the similarity between the two strings. Float32",
        "Implementation details",
        "This function will throw an exception if constant needle or haystack arguments are more than 32Kb in size. If any non-constant haystack or needle arguments are more than 32Kb in size, then the distance is always 1."
