    "Description": [
        "bitShiftLeft(a, b)",
        "Shifts the binary representation of a value to the left by a specified number of bit positions.",
        "A FixedString or a String is treated as a single multibyte value.",
        "Bits of a FixedString value are lost as they are shifted out. On the contrary, a String value is extended with additional bytes, so no bits are lost.",

        "bitShiftLeft(a, b)",
        "Arguments",
        "a \u2014 A value to shift. Integer types, String or FixedString.b \u2014 The number of shift positions. Unsigned integer types, 64 bit types or less are allowed.",
        "Returned value",
        "Shifted value.",
        "The type of the returned value is the same as the type of the input value."
