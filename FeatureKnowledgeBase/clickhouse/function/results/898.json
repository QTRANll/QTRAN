    "Description": [
        "initcapUTF8",
        "Like initcap, initcapUTF8 converts the first letter of each word to upper case and the rest to lower case. Assumes that the string contains valid UTF-8 encoded text.\nIf this assumption is violated, no exception is thrown and the result is undefined.",
        "NoteThis function does not detect the language, e.g. for Turkish the result might not be exactly correct (i/\u0130 vs. i/I).\nIf the length of the UTF-8 byte sequence is different for upper and lower case of a code point, the result may be incorrect for this code point.",
