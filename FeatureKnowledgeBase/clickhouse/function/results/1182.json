        "Values of both samples are in the sample_data column. If sample_index equals to 0 then the value in that row belongs to the sample from the first population. Otherwise it belongs to the sample from the second population.\nThe null hypothesis is that means of populations are equal. Normal distribution is assumed. Populations may have unequal variance and the variances are known.",
