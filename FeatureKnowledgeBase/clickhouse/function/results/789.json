    "Description": [
        "ngramSearch",
        "Like ngramDistance but calculates the non-symmetric difference between a needle string and a haystack string, i.e. the number of n-grams from the needle minus the common number of n-grams normalized by the number of needle n-grams. Returns a Float32 between 0 and 1. The bigger the result is, the more likely needle is in the haystack. This function is useful for fuzzy string search. Also see function soundex.",
        "Functions ngramSearchCaseInsensitive, ngramSearchUTF8, ngramSearchCaseInsensitiveUTF8 provide case-insensitive and/or UTF-8 variants of this function.",
        "Syntax",
        "ngramSearch(haystack, needle)",
        "Parameters",
        "haystack: First comparison string. String literalneedle: Second comparison string. String literal",
        "Returned value",
        "Value between 0 and 1 representing the likelihood of the needle being in the haystack. Float32",
        "Implementation details",
        "NoteThe UTF-8 variants use the 3-gram distance. These are not perfectly fair n-gram distances. We use 2-byte hashes to hash n-grams and then calculate the (non-)symmetric difference between these hash tables \u2013 collisions may occur. With UTF-8 case-insensitive format we do not use fair tolower function \u2013 we zero the 5-th bit (starting from zero) of each codepoint byte and first bit of zeroth byte if bytes more than one \u2013 this works for Latin and mostly for all Cyrillic letters."
