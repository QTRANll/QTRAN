        "floor",
        "Returns the largest rounded number less than or equal x.\nA rounded number is a multiple of 1 / 10  N, or the nearest number of the appropriate data type if 1 / 10  N isn\u2019t exact.",
        "Integer arguments may be rounded with negative N argument, with non-negative N the function returns x, i.e. does nothing.",
