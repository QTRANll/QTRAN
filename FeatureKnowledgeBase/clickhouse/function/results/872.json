        "normalizedQueryHashKeepNames",
        "Like normalizedQueryHash it returns identical 64bit hash values without the values of literals for similar queries but it does not replace complex aliases (containing whitespace, more than two digits\nor at least 36 bytes long such as UUIDs) with a placeholder before hashing. Can be helpful to analyze query logs.",
