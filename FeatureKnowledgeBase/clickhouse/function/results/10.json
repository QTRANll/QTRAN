        "modulo",
        "Calculates the remainder of the division of two values a by b.",
        "The result type is an integer if both inputs are integers. If one of the inputs is a floating-point number, the result type is Float64.",
        "The remainder is computed like in C++. Truncated division is used for negative numbers.",
        "An exception is thrown when dividing by zero or when dividing a minimal negative number by minus one.",
