        "Shifts the binary representation of a value to the right by a specified number of bit positions.",

        "a \u2014 A value to shift. Integer types, String or FixedString.b \u2014 The number of shift positions. Unsigned integer types, 64 bit types or less are allowed.",

        "Shifted value.",
        "The type of the returned value is the same as the type of the input value."
