        "pointInPolygon",
        "Checks whether the point belongs to the polygon on the plane.",

        "Input values",
        "(x, y) \u2014 Coordinates of a point on the plane. Data type \u2014 Tuple \u2014 A tuple of two numbers.[(a, b), (c, d) ...] \u2014 Polygon vertices. Data type \u2014 Array. Each vertex is represented by a pair of coordinates (a, b). Vertices should be specified in a clockwise or counterclockwise order. The minimum number of vertices is 3. The polygon must be constant.The function also supports polygons with holes (cut out sections). In this case, add polygons that define the cut out sections using additional arguments of the function. The function does not support non-simply-connected polygons.",
        "Returned values",
        "1 if the point is inside the polygon, 0 if it is not.\nIf the point is on the polygon boundary, the function may return either 0 or 1."
