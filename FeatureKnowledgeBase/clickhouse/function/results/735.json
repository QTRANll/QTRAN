        "format",
        "Format the pattern string with the values (strings, integers, etc.) listed in the arguments, similar to formatting in Python. The pattern string can contain replacement fields surrounded by curly braces {}. Anything not contained in braces is considered literal text and copied verbatim into the output. Literal brace character can be escaped by two braces: {{ '{{' }} and {{ '}}' }}. Field names can be numbers (starting from zero) or empty (then they are implicitly given monotonically increasing numbers).",
