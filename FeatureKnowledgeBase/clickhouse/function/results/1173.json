        "kolmogorovSmirnovTest([alternative, computation_method])(sample_data, sample_index)",
        "Values of both samples are in the sample_data column. If sample_index equals to 0 then the value in that row belongs to the sample from the first population. Otherwise it belongs to the sample from the second population.\nSamples must belong to continuous, one-dimensional probability distributions.",

        "sample_data \u2014 Sample data. Integer, Float or Decimal.sample_index \u2014 Sample index. Integer.",
        "Parameters",
        "alternative \u2014 alternative hypothesis. (Optional, default: 'two-sided'.) String.\nLet F(x) and G(x) be the CDFs of the first and second distributions respectively.'two-sided'\nThe null hypothesis is that samples come from the same distribution, e.g. F(x) = G(x) for all x.\nAnd the alternative is that the distributions are not identical.'greater'\nThe null hypothesis is that values in the first sample are stochastically smaller than those in the second one,\ne.g. the CDF of first distribution lies above and hence to the left of that for the second one.\nWhich in fact means that F(x) >= G(x) for all x. And the alternative in this case is that F(x) < G(x) for at least one x.'less'.\nThe null hypothesis is that values in the first sample are stochastically greater than those in the second one,\ne.g. the CDF of first distribution lies below and hence to the right of that for the second one.\nWhich in fact means that F(x) <= G(x) for all x. And the alternative in this case is that F(x) > G(x) for at least one x.computation_method \u2014 the method used to compute p-value. (Optional, default: 'auto'.) String.'exact' - calculation is performed using precise probability distribution of the test statistics. Compute intensive and wasteful except for small samples.'asymp' ('asymptotic') - calculation is performed using an approximation. For large sample sizes, the exact and asymptotic p-values are very similar.'auto'  - the 'exact' method is used when a maximum number of samples is less than 10'000.",
