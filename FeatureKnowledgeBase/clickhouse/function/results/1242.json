    "Description": [
        "windowFunnel",
        "Searches for event chains in a sliding time window and calculates the maximum number of events that occurred from the chain.",
        "The function works according to the algorithm:",
        "The function searches for data that triggers the first condition in the chain and sets the event counter to 1. This is the moment when the sliding window starts.If events from the chain occur sequentially within the window, the counter is incremented. If the sequence of events is disrupted, the counter isn\u2019t incremented.If the data has multiple event chains at varying points of completion, the function will only output the size of the longest chain.",

        "Arguments",
        "timestamp \u2014 Name of the column containing the timestamp. Data types supported: Date, DateTime and other unsigned integer types (note that even though timestamp supports the UInt64 type, it\u2019s value can\u2019t exceed the Int64 maximum, which is 2^63 - 1).cond \u2014 Conditions or data describing the chain of events. UInt8.",
        "Parameters",
        "window \u2014 Length of the sliding window, it is the time interval between the first and the last condition. The unit of window depends on the timestamp itself and varies. Determined using the expression timestamp of cond1 <= timestamp of cond2 <= ... <= timestamp of condN <= timestamp of cond1 + window.mode \u2014 It is an optional argument. One or more modes can be set.'strict_deduplication' \u2014 If the same condition holds for the sequence of events, then such repeating event interrupts further processing. Note: it may work unexpectedly if several conditions hold for the same event.'strict_order' \u2014 Don't allow interventions of other events. E.g. in the case of A->B->D->C, it stops finding A->B->C at the D and the max event level is 2.'strict_increase' \u2014 Apply conditions only to events with strictly increasing timestamps.'strict_once' \u2014 Count each event only once in the chain even if it meets the condition several times",
        "Returned value",
        "The maximum number of consecutive triggered conditions from the chain within the sliding time window.\nAll the chains in the selection are analyzed.",
