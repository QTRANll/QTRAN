    "Description": [
        "CAST",
        "Converts an input value to the specified data type. Unlike the reinterpret function, CAST tries to present the same value using the new data type. If the conversion can not be done then an exception is raised.\nSeveral syntax variants are supported.",

        "CAST(x, T)CAST(x AS t)x::t",
        "Arguments",
        "x \u2014 A value to convert. May be of any type.T \u2014 The name of the target data type. String.t \u2014 The target data type.",
        "Returned value",
        "Converted value.",
        "NoteIf the input value does not fit the bounds of the target type, the result overflows. For example, CAST(-1, 'UInt8') returns 255."
