    "Description": [
        "if",
        "Performs conditional branching.",
        "If the condition cond evaluates to a non-zero value, the function returns the result of the expression then. If cond evaluates to zero or NULL, then the result of the else expression is returned.",
        "Setting short_circuit_function_evaluation controls whether short-circuit evaluation is used. If enabled, the then expression is evaluated only on rows where cond is true and the else expression where cond is false. For example, with short-circuit evaluation, no division-by-zero exception is thrown when executing the query SELECT if(number = 0, 0, intDiv(42, number)) FROM numbers(10).",
        "then and else must be of a similar type.",

        "cond \u2013 The evaluated condition. UInt8, Nullable(UInt8) or NULL.then \u2013 The expression returned if condition is true.else \u2013 The expression returned if condition is false or NULL.",
