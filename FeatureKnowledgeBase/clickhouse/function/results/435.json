    "Description": [
        "sipHash128",
        "Like sipHash64 but produces a 128-bit hash value, i.e. the final xor-folding state is done up to 128 bits.",
        "NoteThis 128-bit variant differs from the reference implementation and it's weaker.\nThis version exists because, when it was written, there was no official 128-bit extension for SipHash.\nNew projects should probably use sipHash128Reference.",

        "sipHash128(par1,...)",
        "Arguments",
        "Same as for sipHash64.",
        "Returned value",
        "A 128-bit SipHash hash value of type FixedString(16)."
