        "runningConcurrency",
        "Calculates the number of concurrent events.\nEach event has a start time and an end time. The start time is included in the event, while the end time is excluded. Columns with a start time and an end time must be of the same data type.\nThe function calculates the total number of active (concurrent) events for each event start time.",
        "TipEvents must be ordered by the start time in ascending order. If this requirement is violated the function raises an exception. Every data block is processed separately. If events from different data blocks overlap then they can not be processed correctly.",
