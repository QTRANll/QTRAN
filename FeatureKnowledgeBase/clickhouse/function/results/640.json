    "Description": [
        "neighbor",
        "The window function that provides access to a row at a specified offset before or after the current row of a given column.",
        "Syntax",
        "neighbor(column, offset[, default_value])",
        "The result of the function depends on the affected data blocks and the order of data in the block.",
        "NoteOnly returns neighbor inside the currently processed data block.\nBecause of this error-prone behavior the function is DEPRECATED, please use proper window functions instead.",
        "The order of rows during calculation of neighbor() can differ from the order of rows returned to the user.\nTo prevent that you can create a subquery with ORDER BY and call the function from outside the subquery.",
        "Arguments",
        "column \u2014 A column name or scalar expression.offset \u2014 The number of rows to look before or ahead of the current row in column. Int64.default_value \u2014 Optional. The returned value if offset is beyond the block boundaries. Type of data blocks affected.",
        "Returned values",
        "Value of column with offset distance from current row, if offset is not outside the block boundaries.The default value of column or default_value (if given), if offset is outside the block boundaries.",
        "NoteThe return type will be that of the data blocks affected or the default value type."
