        "contingency",
        "The contingency function calculates the contingency coefficient, a value that measures the association between two columns in a table. The computation is similar to the cramersV function but with a different denominator in the square root.",

        "column1 and column2 are the columns to be compared",
        "Returned value",
        "a value between 0 and 1. The larger the result, the closer the association of the two columns.",
        "Return type is always Float64."
