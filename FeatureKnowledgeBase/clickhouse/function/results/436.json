    "Description": [
        "sipHash128Keyed",
        "Same as sipHash128 but additionally takes an explicit key argument instead of using a fixed key.",
        "NoteThis 128-bit variant differs from the reference implementation and it's weaker.\nThis version exists because, when it was written, there was no official 128-bit extension for SipHash.\nNew projects should probably use sipHash128ReferenceKeyed.",

        "Arguments",
        "Same as sipHash128, but the first argument is a tuple of two UInt64 values representing the key.",
        "Returned value",
        "A 128-bit SipHash hash value of type FixedString(16)."
