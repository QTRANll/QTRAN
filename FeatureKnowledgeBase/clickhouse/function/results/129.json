        "bitCount",
        "Calculates the number of bits set to one in the binary representation of a number.",
        "Syntax",
        "bitCount(x)",
        "Arguments",
        "x \u2014 Integer or floating-point number. The function uses the value representation in memory. It allows supporting floating-point numbers.",
        "Returned value",
        "Number of bits set to one in the input number. UInt8.",
        "NoteThe function does not convert the input value to a larger type (sign extension). So, for example, bitCount(toUInt8(-1)) = 8."
