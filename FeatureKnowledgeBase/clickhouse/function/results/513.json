    "Description": [
        "addressToLineWithInlines",
        "Similar to addressToLine, but returns an Array with all inline functions. As a result of this, it is slower than addressToLine.",

        "Syntax",
        "addressToLineWithInlines(address_of_binary_instruction)",
        "Arguments",
        "address_of_binary_instruction (UInt64) \u2014 Address of instruction in a running process.",
        "Returned value",
        "An array whose first element is the source code filename and line number in the file delimited by a colon. From the second element onwards, inline functions' source code filenames, line numbers and function names are listed. If the function couldn\u2019t find the debug information, then an array with a single element equal to the name of the binary is returned, otherwise an empty array is returned if the address is not valid. Array(String)."
