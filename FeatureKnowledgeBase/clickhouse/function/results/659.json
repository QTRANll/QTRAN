        "initializeAggregation",
        "Calculates the result of an aggregate function based on a single value. This function can be used to initialize aggregate functions with combinator -State. You can create states of aggregate functions and insert them to columns of type AggregateFunction or use initialized aggregates as default values.",

        "The return type is the same as the return type of function, that initializeAggregation takes as first argument."
