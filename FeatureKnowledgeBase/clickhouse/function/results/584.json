UInt64.trials_y: Number of trials in population y. UInt64.conf_level: Confidence level for the test. Float64.pool_type: Selection of pooling (way in which the standard error is estimated). Can be either unpooled or pooled. String. ",
        "NoteFor argument pool_type: In the pooled version, the two proportions are averaged, and only one proportion is used to estimate the standard error. In the unpooled version, the two proportions are used separately.",

        "z_stat: Z statistic. Float64.p_val: P value. Float64.ci_low: The lower confidence interval. Float64.ci_high: The upper confidence interval. Float64."
