    "Description": [
        "match",
        "Returns whether string haystack matches the regular expression pattern in re2 regular expression syntax.",
        "Matching is based on UTF-8, e.g. . matches the Unicode code point \u00a5 which is represented in UTF-8 using two bytes. The regular\nexpression must not contain null bytes. If the haystack or the pattern are not valid UTF-8, then the behavior is undefined.",
        "Unlike re2's default behavior, . matches line breaks. To disable this, prepend the pattern with (?-s).",
        "If you only want to search substrings in a string, you can use functions like or position instead - they work much faster than this function.",
