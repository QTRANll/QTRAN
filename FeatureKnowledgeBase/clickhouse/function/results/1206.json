        "Returns a rank correlation coefficient of the ranks of x and y. The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. If less than two arguments are passed, the function will return an exception. The value close to +1 denotes a high linear relationship, and with an increase of one random variable, the second random variable also increases. The value close to -1 denotes a high linear relationship, and with an increase of one random variable, the second random variable decreases. The value close or equal to 0 denotes no relationship between the two random variables.",
