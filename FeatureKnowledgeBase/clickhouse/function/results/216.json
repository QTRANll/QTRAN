        "toYearWeek",
        "Returns year and week for a date. The year in the result may be different from the year in the date argument for the first and the last week of the year.",
        "The mode argument works like the mode argument to toWeek(). For the single-argument syntax, a mode value of 0 is used.",

        "DangerThe week number returned by toYearWeek() can be different from what the toWeek() returns. toWeek() always returns week number in the context of the given year, and in case toWeek() returns 0, toYearWeek() returns the value corresponding to the last week of previous year. See prev_yearWeek in example below.",

        "The first argument can also be specified as String in a format supported by parseDateTime64BestEffort(). Support for string arguments exists only for reasons of compatibility with MySQL which is expected by certain 3rd party tools. As string argument support may in future be made dependent on new MySQL-compatibility settings and because string parsing is generally slow, it is recommended to not use it."
