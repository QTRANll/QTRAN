        "Function arrayRandomSample returns a subset with samples-many random elements of an input array. If samples exceeds the size of the input array, the sample size is limited to the size of the array, i.e. all array elements are returned but their order is not guaranteed. The function can handle both flat arrays and nested arrays.",
