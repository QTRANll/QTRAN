        "input(structure) - table function that allows effectively convert and insert data sent to the\nserver with given structure to the table with another structure.",

        "This function can be used only in INSERT SELECT query and only once but otherwise behaves like ordinary table function\n(for example, it can be used in subquery, etc.).",
        "Data can be sent in any way like for ordinary INSERT query and passed in any available format\nthat must be specified in the end of query (unlike ordinary INSERT SELECT).",
        "The main feature of this function is that when server receives data from client it simultaneously converts it\naccording to the list of expressions in the SELECT clause and inserts into the target table. Temporary table\nwith all transferred data is not created."
