    "Description": [
        "halfMD5",
        "Interprets all the input parameters as strings and calculates the MD5 hash value for each of them. Then combines hashes, takes the first 8 bytes of the hash of the resulting string, and interprets them as UInt64 in big-endian byte order.",
        "halfMD5(par1, ...)",
        "The function is relatively slow (5 million short strings per second per processor core).\nConsider using the sipHash64 function instead.",
        "Arguments",
        "The function takes a variable number of input parameters. Arguments can be any of the supported data types. For some data types calculated value of hash function may be the same for the same values even if types of arguments differ (integers of different size, named and unnamed Tuple with the same data, Map and the corresponding Array(Tuple(key, value)) type with the same data).",
        "Returned Value",
        "A UInt64 data type hash value."
