    "Description": [
        "splitByChar",
        "Splits a string into substrings separated by a specified character. Uses a constant string separator which consists of exactly one character.\nReturns an array of selected substrings. Empty substrings may be selected if the separator occurs at the beginning or end of the string, or if there are multiple consecutive separators.",
        "Syntax",
        "splitByChar(separator, s[, max_substrings]))",
        "Arguments",
        "separator \u2014 The separator which should contain exactly one character. String.s \u2014 The string to split. String.max_substrings \u2014 An optional Int64 defaulting to 0. If max_substrings > 0, the returned array will contain at most max_substrings substrings, otherwise the function will return as many substrings as possible.",
        "Returned value(s)",
        "An array of selected substrings. Array(String).Empty substrings may be selected when:A separator occurs at the beginning or end of the string;There are multiple consecutive separators;The original string s is empty.",
        "NoteThe behavior of parameter max_substrings changed starting with ClickHouse v22.11. In versions older than that, max_substrings > 0 meant that max_substring-many splits were performed and that the remainder of the string was returned as the final element of the list.\nFor example,in v22.10: SELECT splitByChar('=', 'a=b=c=d', 2); returned ['a','b','c=d']in v22.11: SELECT splitByChar('=', 'a=b=c=d', 2); returned ['a','b']A behavior similar to ClickHouse pre-v22.11 can be achieved by setting\nsplitby_max_substrings_includes_remaining_string\nSELECT splitByChar('=', 'a=b=c=d', 2) SETTINGS splitby_max_substrings_includes_remaining_string = 1 -- ['a', 'b=c=d']"
