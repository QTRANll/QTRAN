        "minSampleSizeConversion(baseline, mde, power, alpha)",
        "Uses the formula described in this article. Assumes equal sizes of treatment and control groups. Returns the sample size required for one group (i.e. the sample size required for the whole experiment is twice the returned value).",
        "Arguments",
        "baseline \u2014 Baseline conversion. Float.mde \u2014 Minimum detectable effect (MDE) as percentage points (e.g. for a baseline conversion 0.25 the MDE 0.03 means an expected change to 0.25 \u00b1 0.03). Float.power \u2014 Required statistical power of a test (1 - probability of Type II error). Float.alpha \u2014 Required significance level of a test (probability of Type I error). Float.",

        "A named Tuple with 3 elements:",
        "\"minimum_sample_size\" \u2014 Required sample size. Float64.\"detect_range_lower\" \u2014 Lower bound of the range of values not detectable with the returned required sample size (i.e. all values less than or equal to \"detect_range_lower\" are detectable with the provided alpha and power). Calculated as baseline - mde. Float64.\"detect_range_upper\" \u2014 Upper bound of the range of values not detectable with the returned required sample size (i.e. all values greater than or equal to \"detect_range_upper\" are detectable with the provided alpha and power). Calculated as baseline + mde. Float64."
