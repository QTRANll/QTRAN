    "Description": [
        "extractKeyValuePairsWithEscaping",
        "Same as extractKeyValuePairs but supports escaping.",
        "Supported escape sequences: \\x, \\N, \\a, \\b, \\e, \\f, \\n, \\r, \\t, \\v and \\0.\nNon standard escape sequences are returned as it is (including the backslash) unless they are one of the following:\n\\\\, ', \", backtick, /, = or ASCII control characters (c <= 31).",
        "This function will satisfy the use case where pre-escaping and post-escaping are not suitable. For instance, consider the following\ninput string: a: \"aaaa\\\"bbb\". The expected output is: a: aaaa\\\"bbbb.",
        "Pre-escaping: Pre-escaping it will output: a: \"aaaa\"bbb\" and extractKeyValuePairs will then output: a: aaaaPost-escaping: extractKeyValuePairs will output a: aaaa\\ and post-escaping will keep it as it is.",
        "Leading escape sequences will be skipped in keys and will be considered invalid for values."
