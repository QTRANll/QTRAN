        "Ranks the current row within its partition with gaps. In other words, if the value of any row it encounters is equal to the value of a previous row then it will receive the same rank as that previous row.\nThe rank of the next row is then equal to the rank of the previous row plus a gap equal to the number of times the previous rank was given.",
