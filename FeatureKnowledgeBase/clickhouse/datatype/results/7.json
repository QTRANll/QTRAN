        "DateTime"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "DateTime",
        "Allows to store an instant in time, that can be expressed as a calendar date and a time of a day.",
        "Syntax:",
        "DateTime([timezone])",
        "Supported range of values: [1970-01-01 00:00:00, 2106-02-07 06:28:15].",
        "Resolution: 1 second.",
        "Speed\u200b",
        "The Date datatype is faster than DateTime under most conditions.",
        "The Date type requires 2 bytes of storage, while DateTime requires 4. However, when the database compresses the database, this difference is amplified. This amplification is due to the minutes and seconds in DateTime being less compressible. Filtering and aggregating Date instead of DateTime is also faster.",
        "Usage Remarks\u200b",
        "The point in time is saved as a Unix timestamp, regardless of the time zone or daylight saving time. The time zone affects how the values of the DateTime type values are displayed in text format and how the values specified as strings are parsed (\u20182020-01-01 05:00:01\u2019).",
        "Timezone agnostic Unix timestamp is stored in tables, and the timezone is used to transform it to text format or back during data import/export or to make calendar calculations on the values (example: toDate, toHour functions etc.). The time zone is not stored in the rows of the table (or in resultset), but is stored in the column metadata.",
        "A list of supported time zones can be found in the IANA Time Zone Database and also can be queried by SELECT * FROM system.time_zones. The list is also available at Wikipedia.",
        "You can explicitly set a time zone for DateTime-type columns when creating a table. Example: DateTime('UTC'). If the time zone isn\u2019t set, ClickHouse uses the value of the timezone parameter in the server settings or the operating system settings at the moment of the ClickHouse server start.",
        "The clickhouse-client applies the server time zone by default if a time zone isn\u2019t explicitly set when initializing the data type. To use the client time zone, run clickhouse-client with the --use_client_time_zone parameter.",
        "ClickHouse outputs values depending on the value of the date_time_output_format setting. YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss text format by default. Additionally, you can change the output with the formatDateTime function.",
        "When inserting data into ClickHouse, you can use different formats of date and time strings, depending on the value of the date_time_input_format setting.",

So after 6th Nov has ended, people observed a whole one minute of 7th Nov, then time was changed back to 23:01 6th Nov and after another 59 minutes the 7th Nov started again. ClickHouse does not (yet) support this kind of fun. During these days the results of time processing functions may be slightly incorrect.",
