When creating a value of type DECIMAL, the WIDTH and SCALE can be specified to define which size of decimal values can be held in the field. The WIDTH field determines how many digits can be held, and the scale determines the amount of digits after the decimal point. For example, the type DECIMAL(3, 2) can fit the value 1.23, but cannot fit the value 12.3 or the value 1.234.

For example, (10::FLOAT / 3::FLOAT)::FLOAT * 3 = 10 whereas (10::DECIMAL(18, 3) / 3::DECIMAL(18, 3))::DECIMAL(18, 3) * 3 = 9.999.", "In general, we advise that:", "\nIf you require exact storage of numbers with a known number of decimal digits and require exact additions, subtractions, and multiplications (such as for monetary amounts), use the DECIMAL data type or its NUMERIC alias instead.\nIf you want to do fast or complicated calculations, the floating-point data types may be more appropriate. However, if you use the results for anything important, you should evaluate your implementation carefully for corner cases (ranges, infinities, underflows, invalid operations) that may be handled differently from what you expect and you should familiarize yourself with common floating-point pitfalls.

The DOUBLE type typically has a range of around 1E-307 to 1E+308 with a precision of at least 15 digits.
