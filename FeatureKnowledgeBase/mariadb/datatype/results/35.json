    "Description": [
        "A date. The supported range is '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'. MariaDB\ndisplays DATE values in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, but can be assigned dates in looser formats, including strings or numbers, as long as they make sense. These include a short year, YY-MM-DD, no delimiters, YYMMDD, or any other acceptable delimiter, for example YYYY/MM/DD. For details, see date and time literals.",
        "'0000-00-00' is a permitted special value (zero-date), unless the NO_ZERO_DATE SQL_MODE is used. Also, individual components of a date can be set to 0 (for example: '2015-00-12'), unless the NO_ZERO_IN_DATE SQL_MODE is used. In many cases, the result of en expression involving a zero-date, or a date with zero-parts, is NULL. If the ALLOW_INVALID_DATES SQL_MODE is enabled, if the day part is in the range between 1 and 31, the date does not produce any error, even for months that have less than 31 days.",
