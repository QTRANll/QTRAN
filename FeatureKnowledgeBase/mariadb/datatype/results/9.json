        "These are the theoretical limits, based on the IEEE \nstandard. The actual range might be slightly smaller depending on your\nhardware or operating system.",
        "M is the total number of digits and D is the number of digits\nfollowing the decimal point. If M and D are omitted, values are stored\nto the limits allowed by the hardware. A single-precision\nfloating-point number is accurate to approximately 7 decimal places.",
        "UNSIGNED, if specified, disallows negative values.",
        "Using FLOAT might give you some unexpected problems because all\ncalculations in MariaDB are done with double precision. See Floating Point Accuracy.",
