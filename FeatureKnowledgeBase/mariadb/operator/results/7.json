        "Assignment operator for assigning a value. The value on the right is assigned to the variable on left.",
        "Unlike the = operator, := can always be used to assign a value to a variable.",
        "This operator works with both user-defined variables and local variables.",
        "When assigning the same value to several variables, LAST_VALUE() can be useful."
