    "Description": [
        "OLD_PASSWORD() was added to MySQL when the implementation of \nPASSWORD() was changed to improve security. OLD_PASSWORD() returns the\nvalue of the old (pre-MySQL 4.1) implementation of PASSWORD() as a\nstring, and is intended to permit you to reset passwords for any\npre-4.1 clients that need to connect to a more recent MySQL server version, or any version of MariaDB,\nwithout locking them out.",
        "As of MariaDB 5.5, the return value is a nonbinary string in the connection character set and collation, determined by the values of the character_set_connection and collation_connection system variables. Before 5.5, the return value was a binary string.",
        "The return value is 16 bytes in length, or NULL if the argument was NULL."
