    "Description": [
        "Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether g1 spatially overlaps g2.\nThe term spatially overlaps is used if two geometries intersect and their\nintersection results in a geometry of the same dimension but not equal to\neither of the given geometries.",
        "OVERLAPS() is based on the original MySQL implementation and uses object bounding rectangles, while ST_OVERLAPS() uses object shapes."
