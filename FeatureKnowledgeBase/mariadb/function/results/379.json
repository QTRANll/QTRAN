    "Description": [
        "Returns a \"short\" universally unique identifier as a 64-bit unsigned integer (rather\nthan a string-form 128-bit identifier as returned by the UUID() function).",
        "The value of UUID_SHORT() is guaranteed to be unique if the\nfollowing conditions hold:",
        "The server_id of the current host is unique among your set of master and\n  slave servers\nserver_id is between 0 and 255\nYou don't set back your system time for your server between mariadbd restarts\nYou do not invoke UUID_SHORT() on average more than 16\n  million times per second between mariadbd restarts\n",
        "The UUID_SHORT() return value is constructed this way:",
        "  (server_id & 255) << 56\n+ (server_startup_time_in_seconds << 24)\n+ incremented_variable++;\n",
        "Statements using the UUID_SHORT() function are not safe for statement-based replication."
