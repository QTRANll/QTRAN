    "Description": [
        "Encrypts a string using the Unix crypt() system call, returning an encrypted binary string. The salt argument should be a string with at least two characters or the returned result will be NULL. If no salt argument is given, a random value of sufficient length is used.",
        "It is not recommended to use ENCRYPT() with utf16, utf32 or ucs2 multi-byte character sets because the crypt() system call expects a string terminated with a zero byte.",
        "Note that the underlying crypt() system call may have some limitations, such as ignoring all but the first eight characters.",
        "If the have_crypt system variable is set to NO (because the crypt() system call is not available), the ENCRYPT function will always return NULL."
