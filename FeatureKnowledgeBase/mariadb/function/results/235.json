    "Description": [
        "Gets the most recent value in the current connection generated from a sequence.",
        "If the sequence has not yet been used by the connection, PREVIOUS VALUE FOR returns NULL (the same thing applies with a new connection which doesn't see a last value for an existing sequence).\nIf a SEQUENCE has been dropped and re-created then it's treated as a new SEQUENCE and PREVIOUS VALUE FOR will return NULL.\nReturns NULL if the sequence is complete\nFLUSH TABLES has no effect on PREVIOUS VALUE FOR.\nPrevious values for all used sequences are stored per connection until connection ends.\nPREVIOUS VALUE FOR requires the SELECT privilege.\n"
