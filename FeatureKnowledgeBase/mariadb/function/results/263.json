    ],
    "Description": [
        "ROW_NUMBER() is a window function that displays the number of a given row, starting at one and following the ORDER BY sequence of the window function, with identical values receiving different row numbers. It is similar to the RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions except that in that function, identical values will receive the same rank for each result."
