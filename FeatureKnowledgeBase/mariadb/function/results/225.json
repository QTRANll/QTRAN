        "The PASSWORD() function is used for hashing passwords for use in authentication by the MariaDB server. It is not intended for use in other applications.\n",
        "Calculates and returns a hashed password string from the plaintext password str. Returns an empty string (>= MariaDB 10.0.4) if the argument was NULL. ",
        "The return value is a nonbinary string in the connection character set and collation, determined by the values of the character_set_connection and collation_connection system variables.",
        "This is the function that is used for hashing MariaDB passwords for storage in the Password column of the user table (see privileges), usually used with the SET PASSWORD statement. It is not intended for use in other applications.",
        "Until MariaDB 10.3, the return value is 41-bytes in length, and the first character is always '*'. From MariaDB 10.4, the function takes into account the authentication plugin where applicable (A CREATE USER or SET PASSWORD statement). For example, when used in conjunction with a user authenticated by the ed25519 plugin, the statement will create a longer hash:",

        "The behavior of this function is affected by the value of the old_passwords system variable. If this is set to 1 (0 is default), MariaDB reverts to using the mysql_old_password authentication plugin by default for newly created users and passwords. "
