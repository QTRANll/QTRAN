    ],
    "Description": [
        "ENCODE is not considered cryptographically secure, and should not be used for password encryption.\n",
        "Encrypt str using pass_str as the password. To decrypt the result, use\nDECODE().",
        "The result is a binary string of the same length as str.",
        "The strength of the encryption is based on how good the random generator is. ",
        "It is not recommended to rely on the encryption performed by the ENCODE function. Using a salt value (changed when a password is updated) will improve matters somewhat, but for storing passwords, consider a more cryptographically secure function, such as SHA2()."
