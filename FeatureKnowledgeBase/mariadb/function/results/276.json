    "Description": [
        "Returns a soundex string from str. Two strings that sound almost the\nsame should have identical soundex strings. A standard soundex string is four\ncharacters long, but the SOUNDEX() function returns an arbitrarily long\nstring. You can use SUBSTRING() on the result to get a standard soundex\nstring. All non-alphabetic characters in str are ignored. All\ninternational alphabetic characters outside the A-Z range are treated as\nvowels.",
        "Important: When using SOUNDEX(), you should be aware of the\nfollowing details:",
        "This function, as currently implemented, is intended to work well with\n  strings that are in the English language only. Strings in other languages may\n  not produce reasonable results.\n",
        "This function implements the original Soundex algorithm, not the more popular enhanced version (also described by D. Knuth). The difference is that original version discards vowels first and duplicates second, whereas the enhanced version discards duplicates first and vowels second. \n"
