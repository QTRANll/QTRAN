    "Description": [
        "This function is useful in replication for controlling primary/replica synchronization.  It blocks until the replica has read and applied all updates up to the specified position (log_name,log_pos) in the primary log. The return value is the number of log events the replica had to wait for to advance to the specified position. The function returns NULL if\nthe replica SQL thread is not started, the replica's primary information is not\ninitialized, the arguments are incorrect, or an error occurs. It returns -1 if\nthe timeout has been exceeded. If the replica SQL thread stops while\n MASTER_POS_WAIT() is waiting, the function returns NULL. If\nthe replica is past the specified position, the function returns immediately.",
        "If a timeout value is specified, MASTER_POS_WAIT() stops\nwaiting when timeout seconds have elapsed. timeout must be greater than 0; a\nzero or negative timeout means no timeout.",
        "The connection_name is used when you are using multi-source-replication.  If you don't specify it, it's set to the value of the default_master_connection system variable.",
        "Statements using the MASTER_POS_WAIT() function are not safe for statement-based replication."
