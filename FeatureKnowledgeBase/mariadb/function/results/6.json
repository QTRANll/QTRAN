    ],
    "Description": [
        "AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() allow encryption and decryption of\ndata using the official AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, previously known as \"Rijndael.\" Encoding with a 128-bit key length is used (from MariaDB 11.2.0, this is the default, and can be changed). 128 bits is much faster and is secure enough for most purposes.",
        "AES_ENCRYPT() encrypts a string str using the key key_str, and returns a binary string.",
        "AES_DECRYPT() decrypts the encrypted string and returns the original\nstring.",
        "The input arguments may be any length. If either argument is NULL, the result of this function is also NULL.",
        "Because AES is a block-level algorithm, padding is used to encode uneven length strings and so the result string length may be calculated using this formula:",
        "16 x (trunc(string_length / 16) + 1)\n",
        "If AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid data or incorrect padding, it returns NULL. However, it is possible for AES_DECRYPT() to return a non-NULL value (possibly garbage) if the input data or the key is invalid.",
        "MariaDB starting with 11.2From MariaDB 11.2, the function supports an initialization vector, and control of the block encryption mode. The default mode is specified by the block_encryption_mode system variable, which can be changed when calling the function with a mode. mode is aes-{128,192,256}-{ecb,cbc,ctr} for example:  \"AES-128-cbc\".\nAES_ENCRYPT(str, key) can no longer be used in persistent virtual columns (and the like).\n"
