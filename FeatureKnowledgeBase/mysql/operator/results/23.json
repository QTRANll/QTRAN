        "\n            The BINARY operator converts\n            the expression to a binary string (a string that has the\n            binary character set and\n            binary collation). A common use for\n            BINARY is to force a character\n            string comparison to be done byte by byte using numeric byte\n            values rather than character by character. The\n            BINARY operator also causes\n            trailing spaces in comparisons to be significant. For\n            information about the differences between the\n            binary collation of the\n            binary character set and the\n            _bin collations of nonbinary character\n            sets, see Section\u00a012.8.5, \u201cThe binary Collation Compared to _bin Collations\u201d.\n          ",
