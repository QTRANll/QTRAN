Because numeric-format\n          IPv6 addresses require more bytes than the largest integer\n          type, the representation returned by this function has the\n          VARBINARY data type:\n          VARBINARY(16) for IPv6\n          addresses and VARBINARY(4) for\n          IPv4 addresses. If the argument is not a valid address, or if\n          it is NULL,\n          INET6_ATON() returns\n          NULL.\n        ",
