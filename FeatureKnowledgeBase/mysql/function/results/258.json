Permitted\n          values of len range from 1 to 1024.\n          For values outside that range, an error occurs. Returns\n          NULL if len is\n          NULL.\n        ",

For\n          use in that context, len must be at\n          least 16. Larger values are permitted, but bytes in excess of\n          16 are ignored.\n        ",
