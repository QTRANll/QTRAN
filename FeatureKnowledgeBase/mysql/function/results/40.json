If the string ends with space, an extra\n              . character is added to avoid problems\n              with endspace trimming should the result be stored in a\n              CHAR or\n              VARCHAR column. (However,\n              use of nonbinary string data types such as\n              CHAR or\n              VARCHAR to store compressed\n              strings is not recommended anyway because character set\n              conversion may occur. Use a\n              VARBINARY or\n              BLOB binary string column\n              instead.)\n\n",
