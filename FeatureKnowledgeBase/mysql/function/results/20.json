        "\n\n                Binary-string evaluation occurs when the argument values\n                have a binary string type, and the argument is not a\n                hexadecimal literal, bit literal, or\n                NULL literal. Numeric evaluation\n                occurs otherwise, with argument value conversion to\n                unsigned 64-bit integers as necessary.\n              \n                Binary-string evaluation produces a binary string of the\n                same length as the argument values.

If the argument size exceeds 511 bytes, an\n                ER_INVALID_BITWISE_AGGREGATE_OPERANDS_SIZE\n                error occurs.
