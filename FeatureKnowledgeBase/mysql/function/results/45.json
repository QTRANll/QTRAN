For example, this statement converts\n            the string 'abc' in the default character\n            set to the corresponding string in the\n            utf8mb4 character set:\n          ",

When CONVERT()\n              was used as part of the expression for an indexed\n              generated column, this could lead to index corruption\n              following an upgrade from a previous version of MySQL. See\n              SQL Changes, for information\n              about how to handle this situation.\n\n"
