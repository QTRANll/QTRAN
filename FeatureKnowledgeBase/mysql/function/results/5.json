By default these functions implement AES with a\n          128-bit key length. Key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be\n          used, as described later. The key length is a trade off\n          between performance and security.\n        ",

Alternatively, start the\n          mysql client with\n          --skip-binary-as-hex\n          to cause all binary values to be displayed as text.) If either\n          function argument is NULL, the function\n          returns NULL. If\n          AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid\n          data or incorrect padding, it returns NULL.\n          However, it is possible for\n          AES_DECRYPT() to return a\n          non-NULL value (possibly garbage) if the\n          input data or the key is invalid.\n        ",

The derived key is used to\n          encrypt and decrypt the data, and it remains in the MySQL\n          Server instance and is not accessible to users. Using a KDF is\n          highly recommended, as it provides better security than\n          specifying your own premade key or deriving it by a simpler\n          method as you use the function. The functions support HKDF\n          (available from OpenSSL 1.1.0), for which you can specify an\n          optional salt and context-specific information to include in\n          the keying material, and PBKDF2 (available from OpenSSL\n          1.0.2), for which you can specify an optional salt and set the\n          number of iterations used to produce the key.\n        ",

The derived key is used to encrypt and\n                decrypt the data, and it remains in the MySQL Server\n                instance and is not accessible to users.

For example:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy INSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text',UNHEX('F3229A0B371ED2D9441B830D21A390C3')));\n                A passphrase can be used to generate an AES key by\n                hashing the passphrase. For example:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy INSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT('text', UNHEX(SHA2('My secret passphrase',512))));\n                If you exceed the maximum key length of 128 bits, a\n                warning is returned. If you are not using a KDF, do not\n                pass a password or passphrase directly to\n                key_str, hash it first.\n                Previous versions of this documentation suggested the\n                former approach, but it is no longer recommended as the\n                examples shown here are more secure.\n              \ninit_vector\n\n                An initialization vector, for block encryption modes\n                that require it. The\n                block_encryption_mode\n                system variable controls the mode. For the same instance\n                of data, use the same value of\n                init_vector for encryption\n                with AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n                  If you are using a KDF, you must specify an\n                  initialization vector or a null string for this\n                  argument, in order to access the later arguments to\n                  define the KDF.\n\n\n\n                For modes that require an initialization vector, it must\n                be 16 bytes or longer (bytes in excess of 16 are\n                ignored). An error occurs if\n                init_vector is missing. For\n                modes that do not require an initialization vector, it\n                is ignored and a warning is generated if\n                init_vector is specified,\n                unless you are using a KDF.\n              \n                The default value for the\n                block_encryption_mode\n                system variable is aes-128-ecb, or\n                ECB mode, which does not require an initialization\n                vector. The alternative permitted block encryption modes\n                CBC, CFB1, CFB8, CFB128, and OFB all require an\n                initialization vector.\n              \n                A random string of bytes to use for the initialization\n                vector can be produced by calling\n                RANDOM_BYTES(16).\n              \nkdf_name\n\n                The name of the key derivation function (KDF) to create\n                a key from the input keying material passed in\n                key_str, and other arguments\n                as appropriate for the KDF.

When you\n                specify kdf_name, you must\n                specify init_vector, using\n                either a valid initialization vector, or a null string\n                if the encryption mode does not require an\n                initialization vector.\n              \n                The following values are supported:\n\n\n\nhkdf\n\n                      HKDF, which is available from OpenSSL 1.1.0. HKDF\n                      extracts a pseudorandom key from the keying\n                      material then expands it into additional keys.\n                      With HKDF, you can specify an optional salt\n                      (salt) and\n                      context-specific information such as application\n                      details (info) to\n                      include in the keying material.\n                    \npbkdf2_hmac\n\n                      PBKDF2, which is available from OpenSSL 1.0.2.\n                      PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function to the\n                      keying material, and repeats this process a large\n                      number of times to produce the key. With PBKDF2,\n                      you can specify an optional salt\n                      (salt) to include in\n                      the keying material, and set the number of\n                      iterations used to produce the key\n                      (iterations).\n\n\n\n                In this example, HKDF is specified as the key derivation\n                function, and a salt and context information are\n                provided. The argument for the initialization vector is\n                included but is the empty string:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy SELECT AES_ENCRYPT('mytext','mykeystring', '', 'hkdf', 'salt', 'info');\n                In this example, PBKDF2 is specified as the key\n                derivation function, a salt is provided, and the number\n                of iterations is doubled from the recommended minimum:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy SELECT AES_ENCRYPT('mytext','mykeystring', '', 'pbkdf2_hmac','salt', '2000');\nsalt\n\n                A salt to be passed to the key derivation function\n                (KDF). This optional argument is available from MySQL\n                8.0.30. Both HKDF and PBKDF2 can use salts, and their\n                use is recommended to help prevent attacks based on\n                dictionaries of common passwords or rainbow tables.\n              \n                A salt consists of random data, which for security must\n                be different for each encryption operation. A random\n                string of bytes to use for the salt can be produced by\n                calling RANDOM_BYTES().\n                This example produces a 64-bit salt:\n              Press CTRL+C to copy SET @salt = RANDOM_BYTES(8);\n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                salt for encryption with\n                AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT(). The salt\n                can safely be stored along with the encrypted data.\n              \ninfo\n\n                Context-specific information for HKDF to include in the\n                keying material, such as information about the\n                application. This optional argument is available from\n                MySQL 8.0.30 when you specify hkdf as\n                the KDF name. HKDF adds this information to the keying\n                material specified in key_str\n                and the salt specified in\n                salt to produce the key.\n              \n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                info for encryption with\n                AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n              \niterations\n\n                The iteration count for PBKDF2 to use when producing the\n                key. This optional argument is available from MySQL\n                8.0.30 when you specify pbkdf2_hmac\n                as the KDF name. A higher count gives greater resistance\n                to brute-force attacks because it has a greater\n                computational cost for the attacker, but the same is\n                necessarily true for the key derivation process. The\n                default if you do not specify this argument is 1000,\n                which is the minimum recommended by the OpenSSL\n                standard.\n              \n                For the same instance of data, use the same value of\n                iterations for encryption\n                with AES_ENCRYPT() and\n                decryption with\n                AES_DECRYPT().\n\n",
