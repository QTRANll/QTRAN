The query shows rank\n            values for each member of a set of values in the\n            val column, which contains some\n            duplicates. RANK() assigns\n            peers (the duplicates) the same rank value, and the next\n            greater value has a rank higher by the number of peers minus\n            one. DENSE_RANK() also\n            assigns peers the same rank value, but the next higher value\n            has a rank one greater. For reference, the query also\n            displays row numbers using\n            ROW_NUMBER():\n          ",
