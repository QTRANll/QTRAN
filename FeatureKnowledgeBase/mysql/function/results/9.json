The\n                only value currently accepted is\n                GroupReplication.\n              \nmanaged_name: The identifier\n                for the managed group that the server is a part of. For\n                the GroupReplication managed service,\n                the identifier is the value of the\n                group_replication_group_name\n                system variable.\n              \nhost: The host name for this\n                replication source server.\n              \nport: The port number for\n                this replication source server.\n              \nnetwork_namespace: The\n                network namespace for this replication source server.\n                Specify an empty string, as this parameter is reserved\n                for future use.\n              \nprimary_weight: The priority\n                of this replication source server in the replication\n                channel's source list when it is acting as the primary\n                for the managed group.
