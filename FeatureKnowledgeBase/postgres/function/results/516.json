    "Description": [
        "Finishes performing an on-line backup. The desired contents of the backup label file and the tablespace map file are returned as part of the result of the function and must be written to files in the backup area. These files must not be written to the live data directory (doing so will cause PostgreSQL to fail to restart in the event of a crash).",
        "There is an optional parameter of type boolean. If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed, without waiting for WAL to be archived. This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving. Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless. By default or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is enabled. (On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always. If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger an immediate segment switch.)",
        "When executed on a primary, this function also creates a backup history file in the write-ahead log archive area. The history file includes the label given to pg_backup_start, the starting and ending write-ahead log locations for the backup, and the starting and ending times of the backup. After recording the ending location, the current write-ahead log insertion point is automatically advanced to the next write-ahead log file, so that the ending write-ahead log file can be archived immediately to complete the backup.",
        "The result of the function is a single record. The lsn column holds the backup's ending write-ahead log location (which again can be ignored). The second column returns the contents of the backup label file, and the third column returns the contents of the tablespace map file. These must be stored as part of the backup and are required as part of the restore process.",
        "This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function."
