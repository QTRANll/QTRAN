    "Description": [
        "Returns the aclitem array as a set of rows. If the grantee is the pseudo-role PUBLIC, it is represented by zero in the grantee column. Each granted privilege is represented as SELECT, INSERT, etc (see Table 5.1 for a full list). Note that each privilege is broken out as a separate row, so only one keyword appears in the privilege_type column."
