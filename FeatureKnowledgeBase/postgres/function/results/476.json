        "Returns the comment for a shared database object specified by its OID and the name of the containing system catalog. This is just like obj_description except that it is used for retrieving comments on shared objects (that is, databases, roles, and tablespaces). Some system catalogs are global to all databases within each cluster, and the descriptions for objects in them are stored globally as well."
