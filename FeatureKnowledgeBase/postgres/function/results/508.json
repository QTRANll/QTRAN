        "Causes all processes of the PostgreSQL server to reload their configuration files. (This is initiated by sending a SIGHUP signal to the postmaster process, which in turn sends SIGHUP to each of its children.) You can use the pg_file_settings, pg_hba_file_rules and pg_ident_file_mappings views to check the configuration files for possible errors, before reloading."
