    "Description": [
        "Promotes a standby server to primary status. With wait set to true (the default), the function waits until promotion is completed or wait_seconds seconds have passed, and returns true if promotion is successful and false otherwise. If wait is set to false, the function returns true immediately after sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the postmaster to trigger promotion.",
        "This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function."
