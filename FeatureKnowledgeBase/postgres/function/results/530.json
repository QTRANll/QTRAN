    "Description": [
        "Request to pause recovery. A request doesn't mean that recovery stops right away. If you want a guarantee that recovery is actually paused, you need to check for the recovery pause state returned by pg_get_wal_replay_pause_state(). Note that pg_is_wal_replay_paused() returns whether a request is made. While recovery is paused, no further database changes are applied. If hot standby is active, all new queries will see the same consistent snapshot of the database, and no further query conflicts will be generated until recovery is resumed.",
        "This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function."
