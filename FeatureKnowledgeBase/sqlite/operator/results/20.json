    "Description": [
        "The GLOB operator performs a pattern matching operation using Unix shell-style wildcards. Unlike LIKE, which uses SQL-like wildcards, GLOB uses `*` (matches any number of characters) and `?` (matches a single character).",
        "Parameters: A TEXT value and a pattern with wildcards.",
        "Returns: True if the TEXT value matches the pattern; otherwise, false."
    ],
    "Examples": [
        "SELECT * FROM files WHERE file_name GLOB '*.txt'; -- Finds text files",
        "SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_code GLOB 'AB?123'; -- Finds product codes starting with 'AB' followed by any single character and ending with '123'"
