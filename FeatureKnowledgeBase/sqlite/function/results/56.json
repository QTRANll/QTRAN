        " Despite the name, this function always returns a value between 0.0\n       and 1.0 equal to (rank - 1)/(partition-rows - 1), where\n       rank is the value returned by built-in window function rank()\n       and partition-rows is the total number of rows in the\n       partition. If the partition contains only one row, this function\n       returns 0.0.\n  "
