    "Description": [
        "\n  The substr(X,Y,Z) function returns a substring of input string X that begins\n  with the Y-th character and which is Z characters long.\n  If Z is omitted then substr(X,Y) returns all characters through the end\n  of the string X beginning with the Y-th.\n  The left-most character of X is number 1.  If Y is negative\n  then the first character of the substring is found by counting from the\n  right rather than the left.  If Z is negative then\n  the abs(Z) characters preceding the Y-th character are returned.\n  If X is a string then characters indices refer to actual UTF-8 \n  characters.  If X is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes.\n  \n  \"substring()\" is an alias for \"substr()\" beginning with SQLite version 3.34.\n"
