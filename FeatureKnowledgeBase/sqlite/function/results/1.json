        "\n  The changes() function returns the number of database rows that were changed\n  or inserted or deleted by the most recently completed INSERT, DELETE,\n  or UPDATE statement, exclusive of statements in lower-level triggers.\n  The changes() SQL function is a wrapper around the sqlite3_changes64()\n  C/C++ function and hence follows the same rules for counting changes.\n"
