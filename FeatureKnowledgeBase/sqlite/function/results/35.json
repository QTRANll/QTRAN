    "Description": [
        "\n  The sqlite_offset(X) function returns the byte offset in the database\n  file for the beginning of the record from which value would be read.\n  If X is not a column in an ordinary table, then sqlite_offset(X) returns\n  NULL.  The value returned by sqlite_offset(X) might reference either the\n  original table or an index, depending on the query.  If the value X would\n  normally be extracted from an index, the sqlite_offset(X) returns the\n  offset to the corresponding index record.  If the value X would be\n  extracted from the original table, then sqlite_offset(X) returns the offset\n  to the table record.\n\n  The sqlite_offset(X) SQL function is only available if SQLite is built\n  using the -DSQLITE_ENABLE_OFFSET_SQL_FUNC compile-time option.\n"
