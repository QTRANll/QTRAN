    "Description": [
        "\n  The like() function is used to implement the\n  \"Y LIKE X [ESCAPE Z]\" expression. \n  If the optional ESCAPE clause is present, then the\n  like() function is invoked with three arguments.  Otherwise, it is\n  invoked with two arguments only. Note that the X and Y parameters are\n  reversed in the like() function relative to the infix LIKE operator.\n  X is the pattern and Y is the string to match against that pattern.\n  Hence, the following expressions are equivalent:\n       name LIKE '%neon%'\n     like('%neon%',name)\n  \nThe sqlite3_create_function() interface can be used to override the\n  like() function and thereby change the operation of the\n  LIKE operator.  When overriding the like() function, it may be important\n  to override both the two and three argument versions of the like() \n  function. Otherwise, different code may be called to implement the\n  LIKE operator depending on whether or not an ESCAPE clause was \n  specified.\n"
