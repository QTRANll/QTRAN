    "Description": [
        "\n  The group_concat() function returns\n  a string which is the concatenation of\n  all non-NULL values of X.  If parameter Y is present then\n  it is used as the separator\n  between instances of X.A comma (\",\") is used as the separator\n  if Y is omitted.\n  \n  The string_agg(X,Y) function is an alias\n  for group_concat(X,Y).  String_agg() is compatible with PostgreSQL\n  and SQL-Server and group_concat() is compatible with MySQL.\n  \n  The order of the concatenated elements is arbitrary unless an\n  ORDER BY argument is included immediately after the last parameter.\n"
