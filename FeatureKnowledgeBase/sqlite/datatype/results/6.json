        "SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values:\n\nTEXT as ISO8601 strings (\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS\").\nREAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\nINTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.\nApplications can choose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date and time functions."
