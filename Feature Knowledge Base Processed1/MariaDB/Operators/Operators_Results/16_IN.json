    "Description": [
        "Returns 1 if expr is equal to any of the values in the IN list, else\nreturns 0. If all values are constants, they are evaluated according\nto the type of expr and sorted. The search for the item then is done\nusing a binary search. This means IN is very quick if the IN value\nlist consists entirely of constants. Otherwise, type conversion takes\nplace according to the rules described at Type Conversion, but\napplied to all the arguments.",
        "If expr is NULL, IN always returns NULL. If at least one of the values in the list is NULL, and one of the comparisons is true, the result is 1. If at least one of the values in the list is NULL and none of the comparisons is true, the result is NULL."
