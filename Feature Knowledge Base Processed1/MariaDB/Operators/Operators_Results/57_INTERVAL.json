        "Returns the index of the last argument that is less than the first argument or is NULL. ",
        "Returns 0 if N < N1, 1 if N < N2, 2 if N < N3 and so on or -1 if N is NULL. All\narguments are treated as integers. It is required that N1 < N2 < N3 <\n... < Nn for this function to work correctly. This is because a fast binary\nsearch is used. "
