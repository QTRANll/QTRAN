        "Logical OR. When both operands are non-NULL, the result is 1 if any\noperand is non-zero, and 0 otherwise. With a NULL operand, the result\nis 1 if the other operand is non-zero, and NULL otherwise. If both\noperands are NULL, the result is NULL.",
        "For this operator, short-circuit evaluation can be used.",
        "Note that, if the PIPES_AS_CONCAT SQL_MODE is set, || is used as a string concatenation operator. This means that a || b is the same as CONCAT(a,b). See CONCAT() for details.",
