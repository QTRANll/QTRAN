        "If called with one parameter, this function returns the natural\nlogarithm of X. If X is less than or equal to 0, then NULL is\nreturned.",
        "If called with two parameters, it returns the logarithm of X to the base B. If  B is <= 1 or X <= 0, the function returns NULL.",
        "If any argument is NULL, the function returns NULL.",
        "The inverse of this function (when called with a single argument) is\nthe EXP() function."
