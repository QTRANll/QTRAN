    "Feature": [
        "CAST(expr AS type)\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "The CAST() function takes a value of one type and produces a value of another type, similar to the CONVERT() function. ",
        "The type can be one of the following values:",
        "BINARY\nCHAR\nDATE\nDATETIME\nDECIMAL[(M[,D])]\nDOUBLE\nFLOAT (from MariaDB 10.4.5)\nINTEGER\nShort for SIGNED INTEGER\n\nSIGNED [INTEGER]\nUNSIGNED [INTEGER]\nTIME\nVARCHAR (in Oracle mode, from MariaDB 10.3)\n",
        "The main difference between CAST and CONVERT() is that CONVERT(expr,type) is ODBC syntax while CAST(expr as type) and CONVERT(... USING ...) are SQL92 syntax.",
        "In MariaDB 10.4 and later, you can use the CAST() function with the INTERVAL keyword.",
        "Until MariaDB 5.5.31, X'HHHH', the standard SQL syntax for binary string literals, erroneously worked in the same way as 0xHHHH. In 5.5.31 it was intentionally changed to behave as a string in all contexts (and never as a number).",
        "This introduced an incompatibility with previous versions of MariaDB, and all versions of MySQL (see the example below). "

    "Examples": [
        "SELECT CAST(\"abc\" AS BINARY);",
        "SELECT CAST(\"1\" AS UNSIGNED INTEGER);",

        "SELECT COLLATION(CAST(123 AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8));",
        "SELECT COLLATION(CAST(123 AS CHAR CHARACTER SET utf8) \n  COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci);",
        "SELECT CAST(0xAA AS UNSIGNED), CAST(x'aa' AS UNSIGNED), CAST(X'aa' AS UNSIGNED);"
