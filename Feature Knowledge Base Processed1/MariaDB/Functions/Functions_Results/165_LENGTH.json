        "Returns the length of the string str.",
        "In the default mode, when Oracle mode from MariaDB 10.3 is not set, the length is measured in bytes. In this case, a multi-byte character counts as multiple bytes. This means that for a string\ncontaining five two-byte characters, LENGTH() returns 10, whereas CHAR_LENGTH() returns 5. ",
        "When running Oracle mode from MariaDB 10.3, the length is measured in characters, and LENGTH is a synonym for CHAR_LENGTH().",
        "If str is not a string value, it is converted into a string. If str is NULL, the function returns NULL."
