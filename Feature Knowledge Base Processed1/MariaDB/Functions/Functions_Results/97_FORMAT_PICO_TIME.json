    "Description": [
        "Given a time in picoseconds, returns a human-readable time value and unit indicator. Resulting unit is dependent on the length of the argument, and can be:",

        "With the exception of results under one nanosecond, which are not rounded and are represented as whole numbers, the result is rounded to 2 decimal places, with a minimum of 3 significant digits.",
        "Returns NULL if the argument is NULL.",
        "This function is very similar to the Sys Schema FORMAT_TIME function, but with the following differences:",
        "Represents minutes as min rather than m.\nDoes not represent weeks.\n"
