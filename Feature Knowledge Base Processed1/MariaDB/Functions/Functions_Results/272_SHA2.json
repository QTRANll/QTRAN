    "Description": [
        "Given a string str, calculates an SHA-2 checksum, which is considered more cryptographically secure than its SHA-1 equivalent. The SHA-2 family includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, and the hash_len must correspond to one of these, i.e. 224, 256, 384 or 512. 0 is equivalent to 256.",
        "The return value is a nonbinary string in the connection character set and collation, determined by the values of the character_set_connection and collation_connection system variables. ",
        "NULL is returned if the hash length is not valid, or the string str is NULL.",
        "SHA2 will only work if MariaDB was has been configured with TLS support. "
