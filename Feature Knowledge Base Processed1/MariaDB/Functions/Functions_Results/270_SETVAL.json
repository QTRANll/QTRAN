        "SETVAL(sequence_name, next_value, [is_used, [round]])\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "Set the next value to be returned for a SEQUENCE.",
        "This function is compatible with PostgreSQL syntax, extended\nwith the round argument.",
        "If the is_used argument is not given or is 1 or true, then the next used value will\none after the given value. If is_used is 0 or false then the next generated value\nwill be the given value.",
        "If round is used then it will set the round value (or the internal cycle count, starting at zero) for the sequence.\nIf round is not used, it's assumed to be 0.",
        "next_value must be an integer literal.",
        "For SEQUENCE tables defined with CYCLE (see CREATE SEQUENCE) one should use both next_value and round to define the next value. In this case the\ncurrent sequence value is defined to be round, next_value.",
        "The result returned by SETVAL() is next_value or NULL if the given next_value and round  is smaller than the current value.",
        "SETVAL() will not set the SEQUENCE value to a something that is less than\nits current value. This is needed to ensure that SETVAL()\nis replication safe.  If you want to set the SEQUENCE to a smaller number\nuse ALTER SEQUENCE.",
        "If CYCLE is used, first round and then next_value are compared\nto see if the value is bigger than the current value.",
        "Internally, in the MariaDB server, SETVAL() is used to inform\nreplicas that a SEQUENCE has changed value.  The replica may get\nSETVAL() statements out of order, but this is ok as only the\nbiggest one will have an effect.",
        "SETVAL requires the INSERT privilege."
