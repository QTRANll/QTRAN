    "Feature": [
        "CONV(N,from_base,to_base)\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "Converts numbers between different number bases. Returns a string\nrepresentation of the number N, converted from base from_base\nto base to_base.",
        "Returns NULL if any argument is NULL, or if the second or third argument are not in the allowed range.",
        "The argument N is interpreted as an integer, but may be specified as an\ninteger or a string. The minimum base is 2 and the maximum base is 36 (prior to MariaDB 11.4.0) or 62 (from MariaDB 11.4.0). If to_base is a negative number, N is regarded as a signed number.\nOtherwise, N is treated as unsigned. CONV() works with 64-bit\nprecision.",
        "Some shortcuts for this function are also available: BIN(), OCT(), HEX(), UNHEX(). Also, MariaDB allows binary literal values and hexadecimal literal values."
