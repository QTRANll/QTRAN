    "Description": [
        "PERCENTILE_CONT() (standing for continuous percentile) is a window function which returns a value which corresponds to the given fraction in the sort order. If required, it will interpolate between adjacent input items.",
        "Essentially, the following process is followed to find the value to return:",
        "Get the number of rows in the partition, denoted by N\nRN = p*(N-1), where p denotes the argument to the PERCENTILE_CONT function\ncalculate the FRN(floor row number) and CRN(column row number for the group( FRN= floor(RN) and CRN = ceil(RN))\nlook up rows FRN and CRN\nIf (CRN = FRN = RN) then the result is (value of expression from row at RN)\nOtherwise the result is\n(CRN - RN) * (value of expression for row at FRN) +\n(RN - FRN) * (value of expression for row at CRN)\n",
        "The MEDIAN function is a specific case of PERCENTILE_CONT, equivalent to PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)."
