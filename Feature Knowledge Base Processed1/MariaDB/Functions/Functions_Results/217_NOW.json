        "Returns the current date and time as a value in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'\nor YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.uuuuuu format, depending on whether the function is\nused in a string or numeric context. The value is expressed in the\ncurrent time zone.",
        "The optional precision determines the microsecond precision. See Microseconds in MariaDB.",
        "NOW() (or its synonyms) can be used as the default value for TIMESTAMP columns as well as, since MariaDB 10.0.1, DATETIME columns. Before MariaDB 10.0.1, it was only possible for a single TIMESTAMP column per table to contain the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as its default.",
        "When displayed in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS table, a default CURRENT TIMESTAMP is displayed as CURRENT_TIMESTAMP up until MariaDB 10.2.2, and as current_timestamp() from MariaDB 10.2.3, due to to MariaDB 10.2 accepting expressions in the DEFAULT clause.",
        "Changing the timestamp system variable with a SET timestamp statement affects the value returned by NOW(), but not by SYSDATE()."
