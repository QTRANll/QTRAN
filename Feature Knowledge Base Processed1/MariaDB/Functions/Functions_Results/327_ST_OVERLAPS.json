    "Description": [
        "Returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether geometry g1 spatially overlaps geometry g2.",
        "The term spatially overlaps is used if two geometries intersect and their\nintersection results in a geometry of the same dimension but not equal to\neither of the given geometries.",
        "ST_OVERLAPS() uses object shapes, while OVERLAPS(), based on the original MySQL implementation, uses object bounding rectangles."

        "SELECT ST_OVERLAPS(GeomFromText('POLYGON((...))'), GeomFromText('POLYGON((...))'));"
