    ],
    "Description": [
        "Returns the bitwise XOR of all bits in expr. The calculation is performed with 64-bit (BIGINT) precision. It is an aggregate function, and so can be used with the GROUP BY clause.",
        "If no rows match, BIT_XOR will return a value with all bits set to 0. NULL values have no effect on the result unless all results are NULL, which is treated as no match.",
        "BIT_XOR can be used as a window function with the addition of the over_clause."
