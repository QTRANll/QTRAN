    "Description": [
        "The NATURAL_SORT_KEY function is used for sorting that is closer to natural sorting. Strings are sorted in alphabetical order, while numbers are treated in a way such that, for example, 10 is greater than 2, whereas in other forms of sorting, 2 would be greater than 10, just like z is greater than ya.",
        "There are multiple natural sort implementations, differing in the way they handle leading zeroes, fractions, i18n, negatives, decimals and so on.",
        "MariaDB's implementation ignores leading zeroes when performing the sort.",
        "You can use also use NATURAL_SORT_KEY with generated columns. The value is not stored permanently in the table. When using a generated column, the virtual column must be longer than the base column to cater for embedded numbers in the string and MDEV-24582."
