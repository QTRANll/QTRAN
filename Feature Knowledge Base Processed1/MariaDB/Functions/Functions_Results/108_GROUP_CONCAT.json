    "Description": [
        "This function returns a string result with the concatenated non-NULL values from a group. If any expr in GROUP_CONCAT evaluates to NULL, that tuple is not present in the list returned by GROUP_CONCAT. ",
        "It returns NULL if all arguments are NULL, or there are no matching rows.",
        "The maximum returned length in bytes is determined by the group_concat_max_len server system variable, which defaults to 1M.",
        "If group_concat_max_len <= 512, the return type is VARBINARY or VARCHAR; otherwise, the return type is BLOB or TEXT. The choice between binary or non-binary types depends from the input.",
        "The full syntax is as follows:",
        "GROUP_CONCAT([DISTINCT] expr [,expr ...]\n             [ORDER BY {unsigned_integer | col_name | expr}\n                 [ASC | DESC] [,col_name ...]]\n             [SEPARATOR str_val]\n             [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}])\n",
        "DISTINCT eliminates duplicate values from the output string.",
        "ORDER BY determines the order of returned values.",
        "SEPARATOR specifies a separator between the values. The default separator is a comma (,). It is possible to avoid using a separator by specifying an empty string.",
        "LIMIT",
        "The LIMIT clause can be used with GROUP_CONCAT. This was not possible prior to MariaDB 10.3.3."
