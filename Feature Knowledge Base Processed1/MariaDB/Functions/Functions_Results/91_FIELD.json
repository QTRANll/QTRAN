    "Description": [
        "Returns the index position of the string or number matching the given pattern.  Returns 0 in the event that none of the arguments match the pattern.  Raises an Error 1582 if not given at least two arguments.",
        "When all arguments given to the FIELD() function are strings, they are treated as case-insensitive.  When all the arguments are numbers, they are treated as numbers.  Otherwise, they are treated as doubles.  ",
        "If the given pattern occurs more than once, the\tFIELD() function only returns the index of the first instance.  If the given pattern is NULL, the function returns 0, as a NULL pattern always fails to match.",
        "This function is complementary to the ELT() function."
