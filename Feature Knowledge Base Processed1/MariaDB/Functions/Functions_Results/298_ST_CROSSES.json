    "Description": [
        "Returns 1 if geometry g1 spatially crosses geometry g2. Returns NULL if g1 is a Polygon or a MultiPolygon, or if g2 is a\nPoint or a MultiPoint. Otherwise, returns 0.",
        "The term spatially crosses denotes a spatial relation between two\ngiven geometries that has the following properties:",
        "The two geometries intersect\nTheir intersection results in a geometry that has a dimension that is one\n  less than the maximum dimension of the two given geometries\nTheir intersection is not equal to either of the two given geometries\n",
        "ST_CROSSES() uses object shapes, while CROSSES(), based on the original MySQL implementation, uses object bounding rectangles."
