    "Description": [
        "Returns a random DOUBLE precision floating point value v in the range 0 <= v < 1.0. If\na constant integer argument N is specified, it is used as the seed\nvalue, which produces a repeatable sequence of column values. In the example below, note that the sequences of values produced by\nRAND(3) is the same both places where it occurs.",
        "In a WHERE clause, RAND() is evaluated each time the WHERE is executed.",
        "Statements using the RAND() function are not safe for statement-based replication."
