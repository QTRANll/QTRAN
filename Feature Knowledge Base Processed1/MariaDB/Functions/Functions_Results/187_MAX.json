    "Feature": [
        "MAX([DISTINCT] expr)\n"
    ],
    "Description": [
        "Returns the largest, or maximum, value of expr. MAX() can also take a string\nargument in which case it returns the maximum string value. The DISTINCT\nkeyword can be used to find the maximum of the distinct values of expr,\nhowever, this produces the same result as omitting DISTINCT.",
        "Note that SET and ENUM fields are currently compared by their string value rather than their relative position in the set, so MAX() may produce a different highest result than ORDER BY DESC.",
        "It is an aggregate function, and so can be used with the GROUP BY clause.",
        "MAX() can be used as a window function.",
        "MAX() returns NULL if there were no matching rows."

    "Examples": [
        "SELECT name, MAX(score) FROM student GROUP BY name;",
        "SELECT MAX(name) FROM student;",
        "SELECT name,test,MAX(SCORE) FROM student;"
