        "Bits are examined from right to left, (from low-order to high-order bits).  Strings are added to the result from left to right, separated by a separator string (defaults as ',').  You can optionally limit the number of bits the EXPORT_SET() function examines using the number_of_bits option.  ",
        "If any of the arguments are set as NULL, the function returns NULL."
