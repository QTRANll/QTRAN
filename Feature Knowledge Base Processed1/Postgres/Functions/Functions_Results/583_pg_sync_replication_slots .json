    "Description": [
        "Synchronize the logical failover replication slots from the primary server to the standby server. This function can only be executed on the standby server. Temporary synced slots, if any, cannot be used for logical decoding and must be dropped after promotion. See Section 47.2.3 for details. Note that this function cannot be executed if sync_replication_slots is enabled and the slotsync worker is already running to perform the synchronization of slots.",
        "If, after executing the function, hot_standby_feedback is disabled on the standby or the physical slot configured in primary_slot_name is removed, then it is possible that the necessary rows of the synchronized slot will be removed by the VACUUM process on the primary server, resulting in the synchronized slot becoming invalidated."
