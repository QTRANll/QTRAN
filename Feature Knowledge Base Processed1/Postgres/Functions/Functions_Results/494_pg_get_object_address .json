    "Description": [
        "Returns a row containing enough information to uniquely identify the database object specified by a type code and object name and argument arrays. The returned values are the ones that would be used in system catalogs such as pg_depend; they can be passed to other system functions such as pg_describe_object or pg_identify_object. classid is the OID of the system catalog containing the object; objid is the OID of the object itself, and objsubid is the sub-object ID, or zero if none. This function is the inverse of pg_identify_object_as_address. Undefined objects are identified with NULL values."
