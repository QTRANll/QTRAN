    "Description": [
        "Reports the commit status of a recent transaction. The result is one of in progress, committed, or aborted, provided that the transaction is recent enough that the system retains the commit status of that transaction. If it is old enough that no references to the transaction survive in the system and the commit status information has been discarded, the result is NULL. Applications might use this function, for example, to determine whether their transaction committed or aborted after the application and database server become disconnected while a COMMIT is in progress. Note that prepared transactions are reported as in progress; applications must check pg_prepared_xacts if they need to determine whether a transaction ID belongs to a prepared transaction."
