        "Returns the result of applying the SQL/JSON path_expression to the context_item.",
        "Only use JSON_VALUE() if the extracted value is expected to be a single SQL/JSON scalar item; getting multiple values will be treated as an error. If you expect that extracted value might be an object or an array, use the JSON_QUERY function instead.",
        "By default, the result, which must be a single scalar value, is returned as a value of type text, though the RETURNING clause can be used to return as some other type to which it can be successfully coerced.",
        "The ON ERROR and ON EMPTY clauses have similar semantics as mentioned in the description of JSON_QUERY, except the set of values returned in lieu of throwing an error is different.",
        "Note that scalar strings returned by JSON_VALUE always have their quotes removed, equivalent to specifying OMIT QUOTES in JSON_QUERY.",
