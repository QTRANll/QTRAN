    "Description": [
        "Returns a set of records describing the foreign key relationships that exist within the PostgreSQL system catalogs. The fktable column contains the name of the referencing catalog, and the fkcols column contains the name(s) of the referencing column(s). Similarly, the pktable column contains the name of the referenced catalog, and the pkcols column contains the name(s) of the referenced column(s). If is_array is true, the last referencing column is an array, each of whose elements should match some entry in the referenced catalog. If is_opt is true, the referencing column(s) are allowed to contain zeroes instead of a valid reference."
