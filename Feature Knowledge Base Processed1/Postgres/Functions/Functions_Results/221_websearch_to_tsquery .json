    ],
    "Description": [
        "Converts text to a tsquery, normalizing words according to the specified or default configuration. Quoted word sequences are converted to phrase tests. The word “or” is understood as producing an OR operator, and a dash produces a NOT operator; other punctuation is ignored. This approximates the behavior of some common web search tools."
