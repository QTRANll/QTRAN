The bitwise NOT operator (~) was removed since it is not applicable to the result of CEIL() in this context, which is a double precision value. Instead, I used CAST(-CEIL(5) AS DOUBLE PRECISION) to achieve a similar numeric transformation without operator errors. 2. The use of backticks for identifiers was replaced with standard identifiers in PostgreSQL, but they remain unchanged since there are no special characters. 3. The overall structure of the SQL statement remains intact, ensuring that all column names and aliases are preserved."
